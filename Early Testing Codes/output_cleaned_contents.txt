Ten Famous Software Engineers & Their Apps | All Engineering Schools (newline) Skip to content (newline) Research Schools & Careers (newline) TEN FAMOUS SOFTWARE ENGINEERS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS (newline) Read about 10 famous software engineers, the applications they created and the software engineering degree they earned. (newline) By Jennifer Wegerer (newline) Software, like a novel or film, can leave some people remarkably pleased and others utterly disappointedâif not at the application itself, then at the software engineer behind it.More likely than not, we have all sat at a keyboard feeling frustrated, and wondering why an application didn't work this way or that.Then again, we may have felt truly in awe, using a piece of software that was so swift and seamless that we'd like to shake the hand of the software engineer who wrote it and thank that person for making it so understandable and so easy to use. (newline) Ten Famous (or Infamous) Software Engineers (newline) Here's a list of some of the most famous software applications and the software engineers who created them. Depending on your point of view, this list might include some of your unsung heroes, or perhaps a few people with whom you'd like to have a few words.

Every single one of the digital experiences we enjoy is the result of code. (newline) But honestly, I know almost nothing about how it works or how the people behind the code â software engineers â do what they do. To find out, I spoke with Lindsey Redd. Lindsey has coded for some of the coolest tech companies in the world: Slack, Lyft, and now Stripe. She shared with me the details about her journey â from wanting to be a doctor, to studying computer science at Stanford, to thriving in the top echelons of software engineering. We also talked about some common misconceptions about software engineers, what itâs like to work in a predominately white and male industry, and how to nail an interview for a job like hers. (newline) Can you tell me a little bit about what your job entails? What does the day-to-day look like? (newline) It can be different depending on the day. But usually, it starts with looking through what I have to do for the day. I know a lot of software teams use task management tools. My team specifically uses Jira as a ticketing system, and we have sprints. (newline) A sprint will be a week or two. In that amount of time, youâre supposed to get âx, y, and zâ done. Iâll look through those to-dos and make sure Iâm on track â look at the tasks I need to do for the day, and do them. (newline) Then coding, of course. But thereâs a lot more to software engineering than coding. You code. You test. You deploy your code. You monitor your code, and make sure things are working properly. But then, there can also be a lot of meetings around product development or new features that need to be built on the team, and how weâre going to build those features. I meet with engineers a lot on the plan for implementation. Thereâs also a lot of pair programming, or working together with another coder to solve problems. (newline) Did you always know that you wanted to be a software engineer? (newline) No, not at all. I didnât even know what it was until I was in college. I wanted to be a doctor in high school or a biomechanical engineer. My dadâs a doctor. My momâs a chemical engineer. So something with STEM, I knew, was going to be my path. But I didnât feel super inspired by the pre-med track or a lot of my engineering classes â I couldnât really see how any of those skills or any of the things I was learning would be applied. I was looking for something else in the STEM field that would be a bit more interesting and motivating to me. (newline) I went to Stanford. And Stanfordâs a huge computer science school. A lot of my friends were taking intro computer science courses. I had never coded. I just really didnât know what it was. But everyone was having a great time and seemed to find it really interesting. So around my sophomore year, I decided to take a class in computer science. My mentality was, if I like this class, Iâll take the next class. And then after that, if I like that class, then Iâll major in it. And thatâs basically what happened. It was at that point I realized this is what I wanted to do. (newline) What were those classes like? When you first started doing it, was it something that you were scared of or intimidated by? Or was it more accessible? (newline) If I hadnât seen other kids taking the classes, other people who didnât know how to code, I would have been a lot more intimidated. But the introductory computer science courses at Stanford are super accessible. I even think theyâre available publicly. They really start from the basics. You donât have to know how to code at all to take the class. The professors were really great and they really walk you through, from the very, very basics, of what you need to know in order to code. (newline) I enjoyed the classes because a lot of it is coding. And that is what I currently do right now on the job. I like that direct application of skills. I am learning things that I will eventually use in my career. (newline) At first itâs a lot of puzzles. You code a little robot that navigates a maze. Itâs simple stuff. I think my final project in my first class was building an extremely basic âFacebook.â They start you off simple and gradually ramp up the intensity. (newline) When you were in college, you interned at both Lyft and Slack. Can you talk a little bit about how you landed those internships and what the experience was like for you? (newline) I had a very interesting path to my first internship. Stanford does a lot of job fairs specifically for computer science students where tech companies in Silicon Valley show up and recruit. I had no idea how to navigate those spaces. I had zero clue how to land a computer science internship. (newline) I got one interview for front-end web development, which I had never done. A lot of Stanfordâs introductory courses focus on back-end work, like algorithms and data structures. So they were asking me questions about web development I just couldnât answer. It was terrible. I was really lost. I had no idea how I was going to get a job for the summer. (newline) Then, I remembered some of my friends were applying to an organization called Code2040. Code2040 is an organization that helps Black and Latinx students who study computer science enter the software engineering tech field. They have partnerships with companies that take on Code2040 interns. And itâs a pretty intense process. You have to do a technical interview to even get into the Code2040 program. You have to do a writing interview and a video interview, as well. (newline) Once you make it into Code2040, at that point you can start interviewing with their partner companies. At the time, Lyft was a partner company with Code2040. I interviewed and the interview process was really hard. But Code2040 definitely helps you navigate that process, as well. So it was a good program for me, as someone who had no clue how to get into tech at all. (newline) I interviewed with Lyft and then eventually got a job offer. Code2040 is a summer-long program. You go to workshops, you network with a lot of other people who are in the program, you work with other companies who are also partner companies. Slack is a partner company who I networked with during my first summer interning and then was able to use that connection when it came to getting an internship the next summer. (newline) Tell me more about the interview process. What was difficult about it? What was that process like? (newline) Now, having worked at Lyft full time, I know that their interview process is very different. But at the time, it was very similar to a lot of other tech companies, where they ask you random coding questions that donât really simulate what itâs like to be a software engineer on the job. Like, I canât tell you the last time, on the job, I used a âbreadth-first search algorithm.â But Iâm pretty sure that was one of my interview questions for Lyft. And you have to code on a whiteboard, which I never really did â usually all of your coding happens on a computer. (newline) The interview test was just not very indicative of what I would be doing on the job. And I really had to study for it. I think studying for software engineering interviews is a whole ordeal in and of itself. And at the time, I didnât really understand that, so I didnât study well. Luckily, I had some skills under my belt that served me in my interview. But it made it difficult because I was very confused about how this was going to translate into my job. (newline) You have to study for software engineer interviews? What does that look like? (newline) The best advice I was given was to buy this book called âCracking the Coding Interview,â which basically goes through all of the different kinds of questions that a lot of the big tech companies use â like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. A lot of mid-size and smaller companies base their interview models off of those large tech companies. (newline) Thereâs a lot of new innovation thatâs happening in that space, which will make the process less of a test that you have to study for. But you usually do. And there are a lot of resources online, like Meetcode. Basically you have to do practice problems, like practice math problems as if youâre studying for a test, except itâs practice coding questions that test you on your knowledge about data structures and different kinds of algorithms â all kinds of things that you have to brush up on in order to do the interviews. (newline) I know a lot of people who give themselves several months to study for interviews before even starting the process with any company. In college, I was definitely studying for at least two months before I would interview. When it came to interviewing for full time, I also started studying a few months before I started interviewing. (newline) So you have to basically start studying before you even know if you have an interview lined up? (newline) Yeah, and a lot of companies understand that that is part of the process. Recruiters are very, in my experience, flexible in giving you as much time as you want to study. For my current job, I remember asking my recruiter if I could have four or five weeks to study before I actually did the interview. And they were like, âOh, yeah, I totally get it.â But a lot of people, once they decide that theyâre going to switch jobs, they know that means itâs time to start studying. (newline) When youâre answering these questions, are you coding live in front of the interviewer? (newline) Yes, in most cases. Lyft does an interview where you get an hour to code a small project on your own. The interviewer doesnât have to be there, so you can focus. But I think in all other interviews that Iâve been in, youâre coding in front of someone or pair programming with someone during the interview. Itâs a lot of pressure. (newline) You do pair program on the job. So interviews that involve pair programming I think are really great. But coding with someone watching and judging your performance is not typical on the job. A lot of it youâre just doing on your own. Itâs definitely something to get used to because itâs not something that you do normally while youâre studying computer science or working as a software engineer. (newline) Tell me more about pair programming. Is it just programming with another person on your team? (newline) Pair programming is when you work with someone on your team or another team on a problem that either you need help on or that you two are solving together. Thereâs usually someone whoâs the âdriverâ and then someone who is in the âpassenger seat.â (newline) The driver is the one whoâs actually typing. But youâre problem solving together. Itâs a very collaborative experience, which I like. I think Iâve learned a lot doing that process, even in interviews. You tend to solve problems a bit better and faster when youâre working with someone in that way. (newline) So you interned at Lyft and then were able to get a full-time gig there. How were you able to turn that internship into a full-time position? (newline) Generally, if you do well during your internship, the company will give you a full-time offer. So the big question is, how do you do well during the internship? (newline) There are a lot of pieces to that. My misconception going in was that I needed to get my project done perfectly and completely, which I didnât do when I was interning at Lyft. I think what people are really looking for when youâre an intern on a team is your ability to communicate, both verbal and written communication, and your ability to problem solve and work your way about an abstract problem. So even if youâre not able to finish the project, demonstrating those communication, organization, and project management skills, and figuring out how to implement them â thatâs a lot of what people are looking for when youâre an intern. (newline) What kind of questions do you ask? Do you make sure you ask questions to solve your problems? How fast are you able to ramp up and learn new technologies, skills, and languages quickly? What kind of energy do you bring to the team? What is it like working with you? (newline) Now, being on the other side and having been an intern mentor, it definitely helps when your intern is super excited and super curious. Thatâs whatâs so fun about having interns. Not only are you helping to bring more people into the company, but you want to make sure that those people are positive and fun to work with. (newline) Exuding that during your internship, that curiosity, that spice and passion for what youâre doing, it definitely helps leave a positive, lasting impression on your team. If you have that, plus youâre able to problem solve and get stuff done, youâre pretty set up to get a full-time offer at the end of it. (newline) I know very little about coding languages. How many coding languages have you learned over the years? And how long does it take to learn a new coding language? (newline) In college, we were learning C and Assembly, which are extremely low-level computer systems languages that you donât usually need to know. I also learned Java and C++. But I donât use those very actively anymore. (newline) In my professional career, I have learned Python, Golang, PHP, React, and Ruby. But every company uses something a little bit different. Or they introduce new languages that do different things. And so thatâs why I mentioned during your internship itâs a good thing if youâre able to exhibit that you can learn quickly. (newline) When I started my internship at Lyft, I didnât know Python. I had no idea what it was. Luckily Python is a pretty approachable language. I think Iâm forever learning these languages. Itâs like learning an actual spoken language in that way, where thereâs things that are changing all the time. Thereâs just a huge mix of things that these languages can do, and so youâre constantly learning what those new things are. (newline) For me, to actively code in a language and feel comfortable in it probably takes four weeks. But even at that point, youâre still Googling a lot of stuff. I feel like I Google how to do âfor loopsâ in certain languages, which is a very basic thing. But each language has different syntax for even simple things. So luckily Google or any search engine is a great resource for learning how to do whatever you need to do in whatever language. (newline) I Google the simplest things all the time. I remember there was some Twitter thread recently where a lot of senior engineers were tweeting the things that they still have to look up. And it just helped a lot with my own imposter syndrome, knowing that these people who I admire a lot because theyâre really great engineers are also looking up very simple things. (newline) How did you get your current job at Stripe? (newline) LinkedIn, honestly. I know LinkedIn is not for everybody. But I definitely use it as a tool for my career. I keep my LinkedIn up to date. I have my email on there. People can reach out. (newline) My current manager at Stripe reached out to me on LinkedIn. She just sent me a message and was like, âHey, Iâm hiring. Do you have any interest?â And Stripe had always kind of been on my radar. I wasnât really planning on leaving Lyft when I did. But I feel strongly that if there is an opportunity that seems interesting to you, you should at least have the conversation. So I did, and it went really well. (newline) From there, I was like, Iâm going to just interview and see where it goes. Maybe it wonât work out, and thatâs fine. So then, I started to study. I did the interview. You do a phone screen interview, which is usually just one or two questions with one person. And then you do an on-site, which now is just all virtual. But the on-site interview involves about five interviews. After that, you find out if you got the job or not, and then you go into negotiations. (newline) I think the hardest part a lot of the time is just getting your foot in the door, getting your resume recognized. I definitely use LinkedIn to help me make those connections. (newline) Do you tend to get reached out to a lot by recruiters? (newline) There are definitely more open software engineering roles than there are software engineers. That gap will continue to grow unless we do a lot more to get more people educated in computer science. A lot of people will reach out to me about their open roles. When I was job hunting, I was very proactive in reaching out to companies that I thought were interesting, even if they hadnât reached out to me. So itâs not all inbound. (newline) But, Iâm very privileged in the sense that I have my Stanford degree. I have Lyft, Slack, and now Stripe all on my resume. And these are really well-respected organizations and institutions. I think I get a lot of inbound traffic because of these names that are on my LinkedIn, and on my resume. I know that thatâs not necessarily the case for a lot of other engineers â great engineers; better engineers than I am â just because they donât have these brand names on their resume. So while there are a lot of open roles, I think that thereâs also a lot of elitism in the industry. (newline) I know of companies that are like, âOh, we only hire from the top five computer science schools,â which is ridiculous. I think thereâs still that weird tension in that there are actually a lot of people who can do this work. There are a lot of open roles. But then people have unreal expectations of what a resume is supposed to look like. (newline) And of course the interviews are intense, as I was describing. Not everyone has the resources to prepare for three months for an interview. So there needs to be some bridging of those gaps there, in my opinion. (newline) When you do have a ton of opportunities like that coming your way, how do you decide which ones are worth your time? (newline) I think it depends a lot on what you want to do. There are a lot of different kinds of software engineering. So when my manager at Stripe reached out to me, it was for a full-stack, more product-engineering role. I was doing a lot of infrastructure engineering at Lyft and was interested in what it would be like to work on a product team. (newline) Stripe is also just super well-known and has a reputation for being a good place for engineers and developers. That was a particular combination that was interesting to me. But someone who wants to work on a lot of AI and machine-learning stuff might not be super interested in a product role at Stripe. So when I get inbound requests for the hot new AI startup, itâs not going to peak my interest as much because thatâs not necessarily where my interests lie. (newline) There are all other kinds of factors, like what size company do you want to work at? Are you interested in a Google-size or a five-person startup? (newline) The company choices Iâve made so far are all pretty on par with each other. Slack, Lyft, and Stripe are all similarly sized, and have similarly sized engineering organizations. Valuations are in a similar realm. They were all pre-IPO when I started working at these companies, which is something that I was particularly looking for. (newline) In the future, that might change. I might look for something completely different. And I think that I probably should at some point just to widen my range of experiences. (newline) But thatâs how I narrow it down. I have a pretty clear idea of what I am looking for when I start a job hunt. And so Iâll filter out based off of those requirements I have. (newline) Youâve mentioned a few types of software engineering? Can you tell me a little more about all the different types? (newline) There are a lot of different types of software engineering. I probably donât even know all of them. Iâm forever learning about new areas where people are innovating. (newline) The basics are front-end, which is more like web development or what you see on your computer screen. Back-end is more like servers and algorithms and things that you donât see as a user but that help power the front-end. And then there are people who are full-stack, who do both of those things. (newline) Thereâs infrastructure engineering, which is building out services, like microservices, servers, monolithic servers, or observability pipelines â things that need to sit underneath the back-end layer in order for it to work. A lot of developer tooling is considered infrastructure, things that keep the upper layers working. Thatâs a lot of what I did at Lyft. (newline) Thereâs machine learning and artificial intelligence engineers. Thereâs data engineering. Thereâs SRE, which is site reliability engineers â they keep the lights on and make sure everythingâs working properly. There are QA engineers, who test the quality of the things that other engineers are building. And they build automated systems in order to test the quality of products. And thereâs mobile engineering â people who build iOS apps, Android apps, which is a whole different kind of skill set. (newline) Anywhere your interests lie, thereâs probably a kind of software engineering that fits that. (newline) Is it challenging to switch between those different types? (newline) I think the most difficult part is just learning the new technology. Hiring managers are pretty open â like if youâve only worked in infrastructure, they are pretty willing to hire you on to a product team or vice versa. That can be good because they have a different perspective than people whoâve only worked in infrastructure. (newline) The biggest thing you have to do is learn the new language and learn the new technologies. And there are a lot of resources in order to learn. There are Udemy courses, books, and online projects or tutorials you can follow to understand how to do something. (newline) I think the parts that are a bit more difficult to learn are maybe AI and machine learning because they require a very specific, more math-based education. Otherwise itâs pretty straightforward to lean into a different area of computer science or software engineering. (newline) If I wanted to become a software engineer, what are the most important skills that I should be developing right now? (newline) Definitely building, testing, and maintaining software is the core skill set. Getting your foot in the door and getting a job is a lot about developing those interview skills, which there are a lot of resources for developing those skills, as well. Iâd say a lot of the skills that people donât really talk about that you need to be a good software engineer are more of the soft skills, like verbal and written communication, organization, and project management skills. (newline) Can you talk a little bit about some of the misconceptions of this career path? (newline) A big misconception is that software engineers just code, which is not true. A lot of my job is writing documentation to explain things to people or communicate or pitch ideas. A lot of it is meetings where we figure out the direction of a particular piece of software or a product. And those all involve a lot of other skills that are not coding. (newline) I think people have this vision of software engineers that weâre in a dark room coding by ourselves all the time, which is the vibe sometimes. Iâm not going to lie. Sometimes thereâs a problem you need to hammer out with code. But a lot of the job is very collaborative and not solo work at all â a lot of planning, being a team player, communicating what youâre doing, and asking questions you might have so that people can help you. (newline) Another piece thatâs huge that people donât really consider is how important mentoring people is in software engineering. That can mean mentoring people who are younger than you or just people who are new to your team. Software engineering is such a team sport, and I think a big skill is making sure that new people who are introduced to whatever it is that youâre working on can work on it, be productive, and be an active member of the team. That involves getting people ramped up, helping them, answering a lot of questions, and being able to communicate your ideas. (newline) Software engineering and the tech industry in general, itâs predominantly white. Itâs predominantly male. Would you mind talking a little bit about what itâs like to navigate an industry like that? (newline) Itâs hard. Itâs definitely a struggle. I have a lot of privilege in that I am able to navigate the field with the school I went to and the jobs Iâve had previously. And even with that, you definitely get people who doubt your skills, doubt your skill set, and undermine your work, which sucks. Itâs hard and not fair and definitely needs to change. (newline) A lot of navigating it, for me, has been my own internal work of staying confident, sure of myself, sure of my skills, my education, and everything that I bring to the table, even if not everyone sees that. Itâs definitely clear that a lot of people, companies, and teams do see the skills that everyone can bring to the table despite their background or the school they went to or company they previously worked at. But depending on the culture of the company, the specific makeup of the company, and your manager, itâs definitely a daily grind to do it. I think itâs more work than the white dude software engineer has to go through to find a team and find a company that will work for you. (newline) One of the things I ask when Iâm vetting companies and teams is, what does diversity look like at the company? How does your company think about or treat diversity and inclusion? Are there other people at the company who look like me who are doing well and feel good? Thatâs definitely a piece of my research. And itâs hard work in and of itself to vet those things and figure those things out. But itâs necessary in order for me to be the best employee or engineer that I can be. (newline) What are some of the other obstacles and challenges of this career path? (newline) It can be different depending on who you are and what you struggle with in particular. For me, I struggle with imposter syndrome. So one of my struggles on a daily basis is just feeling like Iâm doing a good job. It really helps me when people give me feedback at all just so I know how Iâm doing. And also it helps when I get some positive reinforcement. (newline) Because engineering is a space thatâs so male dominated and white male dominated, it often can feel like Iâm not measuring up because I think a lot of people sometimes donât recognize the skills that I have because of my different identity. So staying confident and staying sure of myself has been a particular challenge for me in software engineering. (newline) Thereâs also this notion of the 10x engineer â the engineer who just gets the work done of 10 other engineers and is super productive. That is an ideal that people expect out of engineers. But itâs just not true and not actually attainable, and it can affect work-life balance. Maintaining those boundaries, understanding what youâre able to get done in a day, and knowing that thatâs OK is also something that feeds into imposter syndrome. Itâs something that I have struggled with and that Iâve had to deal with. (newline) What really helps is having a community of people who are doing what youâre doing, either at your company or outside of it, or ideally both, who you can talk to about whatever struggles you have. Because 10 times out of 10, when Iâve asked someone else in my community or in my support group of other software engineers, âHave you struggled with this?â the answer is yes. (newline) And whether they figured out the solution or not, it does feel better to know that other people are dealing with the same things that you are. I would suggest that for any career path, whether it be software engineering or not.  Having your people, having your community, helps with any kind of struggle you may face. (newline) Letâs talk money. What should I expect to get paid in a software engineering role? (newline) It depends on a lot of different factors. Your location â if youâre a software engineer in Alabama, your salary will look different than a software engineer in San Francisco because of the different costs of living. Company size also matters, and what stage of growth theyâre at. The Googles and the Facebooks will have the higher offers. Companies that are maybe pre-IPO and going through a lot of growth, theyâll also have high offers. Companies that are maybe pre-seed startups or seed-stage/Series A startups will have lower salaries. But there are a lot of upsides when you think about equity and stock. (newline) If youâre in one of the coastal locations â San Francisco, New York, LA â some of these larger, more established tech hubs, if you are not making $100,000 out of college, youâre probably being underpaid or could at least find a company that would pay you more. Iâm not sure what that looks like if youâre finding a job in Atlanta, for example. It might look very different. (newline) There are resources online to help you figure out, if you just got an offer, if itâs fair, depending on your location, your level, and the size of the company. I would recommend looking at websites like Levels.fyi and Glassdoor to figure out salary information. (newline) I would also say talk to your friends. People donât talk about how much they make enough, which I think leads to a lot of pay inequity in the industry. I would straight up ask people, âHow much do you make?â When I have seen people realize that they are not being paid fairly, it is because people around them have been honest about what they make and they realize somethingâs not adding up. So I would talk to people and encourage them to be transparent because itâs what needs to happen in order to hold these companies, that a lot of times donât want to pay you fairly, accountable. (newline) What do you love about software engineering? (newline) Itâs the mix of teamwork, collaboration, pair programming, and problem solving with the ability to do a lot of solo work and figure problems out on your own. I enjoy the process of coding and not knowing whatâs really going on, but testing and working through an issue, Googling whatever I need to, and then getting to a solution. That feeling, that gratification of figuring out how to do something or solving a bug, is unmatched. (newline) I enjoy my teams. I enjoy working with people, and I enjoy doing my own thing a little bit. Software engineering definitely allows you to do both and, depending on what kind of company you work at, allows you to do more of one or the other based on what you want. Thereâs a lot of flexibility in that way, too. (newline) Is there anything that you wish youâd known about this career path before you started? (newline) When I started and majored in computer science, I did not know the intensity of interviews and how much you had to study for them. Even if youâre 10 years into your career, if you want to switch jobs, you have to study. I did not know that. (newline) I also wish I would have known all the different kinds of engineering that you can do. When I started my full-time job at Lyft, I didnât really care which part of the stack I was working on. In my head it was kind of all the same. My first two internships were different in what I was working on. But that wasnât what I was really paying attention to at the time. I was just trying to do a good job but not really thinking about, what is it that I want to work on? What are the kinds of problems that I think are interesting and want to solve? Is it infrastructure problems? Is it product problems? Is it front-end? Is it back-end? (newline) For example, I really wish I had invested more time in learning mobile engineering. I could switch into doing that and probably will at some point because I find it interesting. But I just didnât even think about any of those things. It can really change your day-to-day. It can really change the kind of work you do, depending on what kind of team youâre on, what their stack looks like, and what kind of product that they produce. I wish I had known those differences and how those kinds of teams differ in how they operate. (newline) Okay, last question: Who is your career crush? (newline) I really look up to Erica Joy Baker. She is a software engineer. She worked at Slack at the time that I was interning there, and I had known of her before that. She was at Google for a really long time. And now she has transitioned into management and is the Chief Technology Officer for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. I just really like the way that she shows up. I had the opportunity to speak with her a few years ago about her work and about how she approaches her work. She also writes a lot online to give you more insight into how sheâs thinking. (newline) She is someone who brings her whole self to work and uses her unique qualities to lead. I really admire that and would love to exude more of that at work. She seems to be super confident in herself and her skills. And people are super confident in her because of that. And I also admire that. (newline) Also, transitioning into management and moving up that career ladder into a director of engineering is also something thatâs super interesting to me and I think something that I will eventually pursue. I think theyâre solving a higher level of engineering questions about organization and how people work together, which is super interesting to me. (newline) New!

Job Types, Training, and Salary (newline) By The Fullstack Academy Team (newline) This blog post was updated in February 2022. (newline) Anytime you visit a webpage or use an internet-powered application, youâre engaging with the end result of a software engineerâs work. (newline) What is a Software Engineer? (newline) Software engineers are computer science professionals who use knowledge of engineering principles and programming languages to build software products, develop computer games, and run network control systems. (newline) According to the US Department of Labor, there were well over 1 million people employed as software developers in 2020. (newline) As more and more of us rely on smart devices, the number of software developers will only increase, with job outlook predicted to grow at 22 percent by 2030. (newline) To help you learn more about careers in software development, this article will cover the following topics: (newline) What Does a Software Engineer Do and Types of Software Engineers (newline) Software Engineering Jobs and Salaries (newline) How to Become a Software Engineer What Does a Software Engineer Do & Types of Software Engineers The software engineering field is broad. Developers have different sets of technical expertise, from building computer information systems to maintaining network security to creating customer-facing web pages. (newline) There are two primary types of software engineers: applications software developers and systems software developers. Applications Software DevelopersOverviewClient-focusedDesign software for the end user to interact withDevelop applications for iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and moreConduct requirements analysisTweak software and release updates regularlyFront-end or back-end?BothWho they work withGraphic designers, project managers, marketers, and customer success staffSystems Software DevelopersOverviewBuild operating systems and networks for user-facing applicationsResponsible for both the hardware and software needsIntegrate disparate software products onto one platformOften serve as general IT managers or systems architectsDesign and enforce IT standardsMaintain IT documentation and update to new technologiesFront-end or back-end? Mostly back-end Who they work with Data science professionals, senior systems architects, development teams, and senior management Software Engineering Jobs and Salaries Thanks to strong industry demand and their own technical expertise, skilled software engineers on both the applications and the systems sides are compensated well for the value they deliver. The Bureau of Labor Statistics lists the median annual salary for applications developers at $105,310 and at $110,140 for systems developers. (newline) Of course, applications and systems developer jobs are not the only two positions available in the field of software engineering. Other common roles include mobile developers, applications architects, quality assurance analysts, and database administrators. How to Become a Software Engineer Completing a two- or four-year computer science degree has, until recently, been the only path to successfully launching a career as a software engineer. Other math- and science-related degrees in fields like information systems, electronics, and civil engineering or even community college courses have also enabled people to transition into software development. (newline) But a formal degree or some college coursework are no longer the only paths to becoming a web developer. Coding bootcamps are an increasingly popular option for those who want to quickly transition into software engineering. (newline) Coding bootcamps are intensive eight- to 30-week programs that focus on practical, language-specific programming skills but also typically cover information technology fundamentals. Most bootcamps are designed to prepare students to enter the IT job market ASAP and focus on the skills most in-demand within online or in a certain geography (check out these online coding bootcamps). (newline) Before you choose a program, consider which type of job you are looking for and which language you should therefore learn. Based in New York? Check out these 10 Free Coding Classes in NYC. (newline) Once your training is complete, youâll need to build up your portfolio and touch up your software engineer rÃ©sumÃ©. Every Industry Needs Software With the proper qualifications, a software engineer can work in almost any industry with any type of organization. While IT firms lead the pack in hiring software developers, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, healthcare facilities, transit and logistics companies, and every other business needs software.

(newline) Cloud & Networking (newline) DevOps (newline) Programming (newline) Insights (newline) News (newline) 18 people in tech every programmer and software engineer needs to follow in 2019 (newline) By (newline) Richard Gall (newline) - (newline) January 2, 2019 - 10:03 am 7746 (newline) 0 (newline) 8 min read After a tumultuous 2018 in tech, it’s vital that you surround yourself with a variety of opinions and experiences in 2019 if you’re to understand what the hell is going on. (newline) While there are thousands of incredible people working in tech, I’ve decided to make life a little easier for you by bringing together 18 of the best people from across the industry to follow on Twitter. (newline) From engineers at Microsoft and AWS, to researchers and journalists, this list is by no means comprehensive but it does give you a wide range of people that have been influential, interesting, and important in 2018. (newline) (A few of) the best people in tech on Twitter (newline) April Wensel (@aprilwensel) (newline) April Wensel is the founder of Compassionate Coding, an organization that aims to bring emotional intelligence and ethics into the tech industry. In April 2018 Wensel wrote an essay arguing that “it’s time to retire RTFM” (read the fucking manual). The essay was well received by many in the tech community tired of a culture of ostensible caustic machismo and played a part in making conversations around community accessibility an important part of 2018. (newline) Watch her keynote at NodeJS Interactive: (newline) Liz Fong-Jones (@lizthegrey) (newline) Liz Fong-Jones is an SRE and Dev Advocate at Google Cloud Platform, but over the last couple of years she has become an important figure within tech activism. First helping to create the NeverAgain pledge in response to the election of Donald Trump in 2016, then helping to bring to light Google’s fraught internal struggle over diversity, Fong-Jones has effectively laid the foundations for the mainstream appearance of tech activism in 2018. (newline) In an interview with Fast Company, Fong-Jones says she has accepted her role as a spokesperson for the movement that has emerged, but she’s committed to helping to “equipping other employees to fight for change in their workplacesâwhether at Google or not âso that Iâm not a single point of failure.” (newline) Ana Medina (@Ana_M_Medina) (newline) Ana Medina is a chaos engineer at Gremlin. Since moving to the chaos engineering platform from Uber (where she was part of the class action lawsuit against the company), Medina has played an important part in explaining what chaos engineering looks like in practice all around the world. (newline) But she is also an important voice in discussions around diversity and mental health in the tech industry – if you get a chance to her her talk, make sure you take the chance, and if you don’t, you’ve still got Twitter… (newline) Sarah Drasner (@sarah_edo) (newline) Sarah Drasner does everything. She’s a Developer Advocate at Microsoft, part of the VueJS core development team, organizer behind Concatenate (a free conference for Nigerian developers), as well as an author too. (newline) Some thoughts as we carry into the new year:– It usually takes a few tries at something to improve– Respect is earned, not given– You don't have do everything at once, small changes over time can add up– Pay more attention to a person's actions then what is said about them (newline) — Sarah Drasner (@sarah_edo) December 30, 2018 (newline) Although Drasner specializes in front end development and JavaScript, she’s a great person to follow on Twitter for her broad insights on how we learn and evolve as software developers. Do yourself a favour and follow her. (newline) Mark Imbriaco (@markimbriaco) (newline) Mark Imbriaco is the technical director at Epic Games. Given the company’s truly, er, epic year thanks to Fortnite, Imbriaco can offer an insight on how one of the most important and influential technology companies on the planet are thinking. (newline) Corey Quinn (@QuinnyPig) (newline) Corey Quinn is an AWS expert. As the brain behind the Last Week in AWS newsletterÂ and the voice behind the Screaming in the Cloud podcast (possibly the best cloud computing podcast on the planet), he is without a doubt the go-to person if you want to know what really matters in cloud. (newline) The range of guests that Quinn gets on the podcast is really impressive, and sums up his online persona: open, engaged, and always interesting. (newline) Yasmine Evjen (@YasmineEvjen) (newline) Yasmine Evjen is a Design Advocate at Google. That means that she is not only one of the minds behind Material Design, she is also someone that is helping to demonstrate the importance of human centered design around the world. (newline) As the presenter of Centered, a web series by the Google Design team about the ways human centered design is used for a range of applications. If you haven’t seen it, it’s well worth a watch. (newline) Suz Hinton (@noopkat) (newline) Suz Hinton works on IoT programs at Microsoft. That’s interesting in itself, but when she’s not developing fully connected smart homes (possibly), Hinton also streams code tutorials on Twitch (also as noopkat). (newline) Chris Short (@ChrisShort) (newline) If you want to get the lowdown on all things DevOps, you could do a lot worse than Chris Short. He boasts outstanding credentials – he’s a CNCF ambassador, has experience with Red Hat and Ansible – but more importantly is the quality of his insights. (newline) A great place to begin is with DevOpsish, a newsletter Short produces, which features some really valuable discussions on the biggest issues and talking points in the field. (newline) Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) (newline) Dan Abramov is one of the key figures behind ReactJS. Along withÂ @sophiebits,@jordwalke, andÂ @sebmarkbage, Abramov is quite literally helping to define front end development as we know it. (newline) If you’re a JavaScript developer, or simply have any kind of passing interest in how we’ll be building front ends over the next decade, he is an essential voice to have on your timeline. (newline) As you’d expect from someone that has helped put together one of the most popular JavaScript libraries in the world, Dan is very good at articulating some of the biggest challenges we face as developers and can provide useful insights on how to approach problems you might face, whether day to day or career changing. (newline) Emma Wedekind (@EmmaWedekind) (newline) As well as working at GoTo Meeting, Emma Wedekind is the founder of Coding Coach, a platform that connects developers to mentors to help them develop new skills. (newline) This experience makes Wedekind an important authority on developer learning. And at a time when deciding what to learn and how to do it can feel like such a challenging and complex process, surrounding yourself with people taking those issues seriously can be immensely valuable. (newline) Jason Lengstorf (@jlengstorf) (newline) Jason Lengstorf is a Developer Advocate at GatsbyJS (a cool project that makes it easier to build projects with React). (newline) His writing – on Twitter and elsewhere – is incredibly good at helping you discover new ways of working and approaching problems. (newline) Bridget Kromhout (@bridgetkromhout) (newline) Bridget Kromhout is another essential voice in cloud and DevOps. Currently working at Microsoft as Principal Cloud Advocate, Bridget also organizes DevOps Days and presents the Arrested DevOps podcast with Matty Stratton and Trevor Hess. (newline) Follow Bridget for her perspective on DevOps, as well as her experience in DevRel. (newline) Ryan Burgess (@burgessdryan) (newline) Netflix hasn’t faced the scrutiny of many of its fellow tech giants this year, which means it’s easy to forget the extent to which the company is at the cutting edge of technological innovation. (newline) This is why it’s well worth following Ryan Burgess – as an engineering manager he’s well placed to provide an insight on how the company is evolving from a tech perspective. (newline) His talk at Real World React on A/B testing user experiences is well worth watching: (newline) Anil Dash (@anildash) (newline) Okay, so chances are you probably already follow Anil Dash – he does have half a million followers already, after all – but if you don’t follow him, you most definitely should. (newline) Dash is a key figure in new media and digital culture, but he’s not just another thought leader, he’s someone that actually understands what it takes to actually build this stuff. As CEO of Glitch, a platform for building (and ‘remixing’) cool apps, he’s having an impact on the way developers work and collaborate. (newline) 6 years ago, Dash wrote an essay called ‘The Web We Lost‘. In it, he laments how the web was becoming colonized by a handful of companies who built the key platforms on which we communicate and engage with one another online. Today, after a year of protest and controversy, Dash’s argument is as salient as ever – it’s one of the reasons it’s vital that we listen to him. (newline) Jessie Frazelle (@jessfraz) (newline) Jessie Frazelle is a bit of a superstar. Which shouldn’t really be that surprising – she’s someone that seems to have a natural ability to pull things apart and put them back together again and have the most fun imaginable while doing it. (newline) Formerly part of the core Docker team, Frazelle now works at GitHub, where her knowledge and expertise is helping to develop the next Microsoft-tinged chapter in GitHub’s history. (newline) I was lucky enough to see Jessie speak at ChaosConf in September – check out her talk: (newline) Rachel Coldicutt (@rachelcoldicutt) (newline) Rachel Coldicutt is the CEO of Doteveryone, a think tank based in the U.K. that champions responsible tech. If you’re interested in how technology interacts with other aspects of society and culture, as well as how it is impacting and being impacted by policymakers, Coldicutt is a vital person to follow. (newline) Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) (newline) Kelsey Hightower is another superstar in the tech world – when he talks, you need to listen. Hightower currently works at Google Cloud, but he spends a lot of time at conferences evangelizing for more effective cloud native development. (newline) .@kelseyhightowerâs #KubeCon demo showed us– docker as a compiler– what multicloud really looks like– what serverless really looks like– what FaaS really looks like (newline) But most of all he nailed the human element. And reminded us of the big picture. A brilliant storyteller. (newline) — Matt Rickard (@mattrickard) December 13, 2018 (newline) If you’re interested in anything infrastructure or cloud related, you need to follow Kelsey Hightower. (newline) Who did I miss? (newline) That’s just a list of a few people in tech I think you should follow in 2019 – but who did I miss? Which accounts are essential? What podcasts and newsletters should we subscribe to?

New Intel - How Many Software Engineers Are There in 2022? (newline) Find a Job (newline) Blog (newline) Post a Job (newline) Find a Job (newline) Blog (newline) Post a Job (newline) Blog (newline) New Intel - How Many Software Engineers Are There in 2022? (newline) New Intel - How Many Software Engineers Are There in 2022? (newline) Written by (newline) Ana Djurovic (newline) Last Updated (newline) January 28, 2022 (newline) Have you ever found yourself wondering just how many software engineers are there in the US? And if this is a solid career choice? Who are these software developers, and where are they based? (newline) If so, youâre not alone, as many people wonder the same thing. Our software engineer statistics have the answers to all of these questions - and more. (newline) Letâs dive right in. (newline) Spectacular Software Development Statistics (newline) The US is home to more than 4.4 million software developers. (newline) 88% of software engineers are male. (newline) There are 1,365,500 software developer jobs available. (newline) Employment for software developers is expected to grow by 21%. (newline) The employment rate amongst software developers is 87%. (newline) The demand for blockchain engineers increases by 517% every year. (newline) Samsung alone employs 40,506 operations software engineers. (newline) In 2017, there were less than 50,000 Computer Science graduates and over 500,000 open positions. (newline) Stats on How Many Software Engineers Are there in the US? (newline) And what countries should the US be keeping its eye on to make sure its talent remains on their turf? (newline) Letâs find out. (newline) 1. The US has more than 4.4 million software developers. (newline) Itâs estimated that more than 4.4 million software developers call the US home. Software engineer statistics show that this makes the US home to the most software engineers. But not for longâ¦ (newline) 2. India will overtake the USâs number of software developers by 2023. (newline) By the time 2023 is over, India will have the biggest concentration of software developers. Back in 2017, India had around 2.75 million. But by 2023, this number will skyrocket to 5.2 million. (newline) 3. 837,000 devs are based in Germany. (newline) Europe is home to a bunch of software developers, too! If you were wondering how many software engineers are there in Europe, hereâs the data: more than 813,000 live and work in the UK, 467,454 are based in France, and 368,291 get their development done in Russia. (newline) 4. Chinaâs software developer industry is growing at 6% to 8%. (newline) Other countries may be ahead, but no country's pool of software developer talent is growing as fast as Chinaâs. (newline) How many developers are there in the world? Well, youâll have to make it all the way to the end of this article to find out. We like keeping you on your toes like that. (newline) US Software Engineering Demographics (newline) Now that we know how many software engineers are in the US, itâs time to take a closer look at who these people are. (newline) 5. 89% of software engineers are men. (newline) When it comes to the number of male vs female software engineers, women sure do get the short end of the stick. In fact, women make up only 11% of the entire software engineering workforce. (newline) 6. 41% of software engineers are white. (newline) Software engineer race demographics are an interesting topic since many races are underrepresented. But still, we like the inclusivity and hope to see it continue. The bulk (41%) of engineers are white, 24% are South Asian, 12% are East Asian, 9% are âother,â 6% are Hispanic, 5% are black, and 3% are Arab. (newline) 7. 71% of software developers are married. (newline) Why is it surprising to discover that over two-thirds of software developers are married? Perhaps it has something to do with the mediaâs depiction of software developers being skinny, pale, greasy-haired computer nerds with a fear of sunlight and terrible social skills. (newline) Clearly, thatâs not the case. (newline) 8. The average age of software developers is 43.1 years. (newline) You may think that software engineering is a young personâs game, but the average age is actually 43.1 years. The most common ages for people in this field are 30 and 34 years of age. (newline) US Software Developer Employment Statistics (newline) Now that you know a little more about the US software engineering demographics, letâs take a look at the job outlook of these people by diving into these US software developer employment statistics. (newline) 9. Employment for software developers is expected to grow by 21%. (newline) According to software engineer labor statistics, the employment outlook for 2018 to 2028 is growing at a steady rate of 21% which is MUCH faster than average across a multitude of industries. (newline) 10. There are 1,365,500 software developer jobs. (newline) In 2018, there were a whopping 1,365,500 software developer jobs available. And in the period from 2018 to 2028, this number is set to increase by 284,100. (newline) 11. 78% of software engineers change jobs for higher compensation. (newline) The question of âHow often do software engineers change jobs?â is tough to answer, as it varies from person to person. What we can tell you is WHY they would want to leave. Close to eight in ten would change jobs for higher compensation. Other reasons include growth opportunities, location and commute, company culture, as well as not enjoying the type of work they do. (newline) 12. The employment rate among software developers is 87%. (newline) If you ever wonder whether or not a career in software development or engineering is a safe bet, consider the fact that the vast majority of all software developers are employed. (newline) But just where are they employed? (newline) US Software Engineers Hubs Statistics (newline) What are the states with the highest number of programmers? What are the best cities for software engineers in US? Are certain areas better than others? (newline) So many questions, so little time! (newline) 13. California is home to 628,414 programmers. (newline) California is one of the best USA IT hubs. The states with the highest number of programmers are California, Texas (324,717), New York (218,041), and Virginia (204,699), also including remote programming jobs and positions. (newline) Now that we know the states with the highest number of programmers, letâs discover the best cities for software engineers in US. (newline) 14. Seattle is the best city for software engineers. (newline) Seattle, WA, is undoubtedly amongst the best cities for software engineers in US. With big tech companies like Microsoft, Salesforce, Adobe, and DocuSign driving the industry at a rate of 47.7%, itâs easy to see why. (newline) 15. The San Jose tech industry is growing at 79.6%. (newline) The number of tech jobs in San Jose has grown by 80% in the last decade, and the industry is currently growing at 79.6%, making it another one of the best cities for software engineers in US. (newline) 16. Dallas is the 11th best-paying city for software engineers. (newline) Dallas is one of the states with the highest density of programmers. But while many choose to settle there, itâs only the 11th best-paying city for software engineers. (newline) Software Developer Shortage Statistics (newline) As you may know, there is a shortage of software developers. How severe is this shortage? Weâll let these software developer shortage statistics and general developer talent facts answer this one. (newline) 17. There are 5 jobs for every 1 software developer. (newline) Jeez! Itâs pretty clear that there is a massive supply and demand problem when it comes to software developers. (newline) And thatâs not all: (newline) 18. The demand for blockchain engineers increases by 517% every year. (newline) Year over year the demand for software engineers increases massively. The latest startup statistics indicated that the demand for software engineers in the blockchain field is particularly intense. (newline) 19. In 2017, there were less than 50,000 Computer Science graduates and over 500,000 open positions. (newline) With less than 50,000 graduates and more than 500,00 positions that need filling, itâs clearly a sellerâs market, not a buyerâs market. (newline) When we average things out: (newline) There are less than 30,000 Computer Science students who graduate each year. At that rate it will take 8 years to fill the open positions available today. (newline) 20. It takes an average of 35 days to hire a software engineer. (newline) Maybe one of the reasons we find ourselves in a software developer shortage is because it takes over a month to hire one. (newline) Most Popular Software Engineering Fields (newline) So, just what are the software engineers who form part of the workforce up to these days? (newline) Letâs take a look at the most popular software engineering fields that employ a large portion of qualified professionals. (newline) 21. There are 20 million registered iOS developers. (newline) Mobile application development sure does keep developers busy. On the App Store alone, there are 20 million software developers who cater to the 500 million app users who visit the Store weekly. (newline) 22. Samsung alone employs 40,506 operations software engineers. (newline) This is huge! In contrast, Google employs only 18,593 people spread across its research and development sectors. (newline) 23. There are approximately 421,300 jobs for computer systems software engineers. (newline) These jobs are spread out across various industries. Computer services provide the bulk of jobs (31%), the manufacturing industry offers 19%, the finance and insurance sector employs 6%, and the remainder is made up of software publishers and engineering services. (newline) 24. There are 67,180 computer hardware engineers. (newline) While this job may not be the most popular, there are currently 64,400 jobs available for computer hardware engineers. (newline) How Much Software Developers Make in the US (newline) Have you been wondering how much software developers make in the US? Or if thereâs a pay gap between male vs female software engineers? And if working in an office or from home has an impact on salary? (newline) Letâs find out. (newline) 25. The median pay for software developers is $105,590 per year. (newline) In 2018 the software engineer average salary was $105,590 per year or $50.77 per hour. Not bad at all, is it? (newline) 26. ...But not all states pay the same. Washington software developers earned $131,790 last year, while Wyoming devs earned $72,210. (newline) The software engineer average salary in Washington was a whopping $131,790. In California, it was $127,950, and the figure for New York was $116,830. In Wyoming, software developers earned $72,210. In South Dakota, they earned $75,000, and those in Louisiana earned $81,640. (newline) 27. Female software developers make 83 cents to the dollar men earn. (newline) Working the exact same job, women earn quite a bit less than men. That works out to $16,640 less per year. (newline) 28. Freelance software engineers earn around $104,463 per year. (newline) While freelance software engineer rates vary according to states, most earn around $104,463 per year. (newline) Speaking of freelance software engineersâ¦ (newline) Freelancer Software Engineers Statistics (newline) How many software engineers work from home? And should you opt for a freelance software engineer or one that is employed by an agency? Letâs find out. (newline) 29. 12% of software engineers (newline) work remotely full-time . (newline) Slightly more than one in ten software engineers work from home 100% of the time. (newline) 30. 57.9% of freelance software engineers prefer working in an office environment. (newline) Somewhat surprisingly, more than half of all freelance software engineers actually prefer working in an office. 33.2% prefer working from home, and the remaining 8.8% prefer working from co-working spaces or coffee shops. (newline) 31. Freelance software engineer rates are typically 203% lower than the rates of software agencies. (newline) If youâve been wondering whether to give your development work to a freelancer or an agency, you should know that freelance software engineer rates can be up to 203% lower. We just made that decision a little easier--youâre welcome. (newline) 32. Toptal, Upwork, Guru, and Gigster are the top sites for freelancers. (newline) The software engineer job market 2019 saw was largely online. Toptal, Upwork, Guru, and Gigster had the most freelance dev jobs according to freelancer software engineer statistics. (newline) And on that note... (newline) To Sum Up (newline) How many software engineers are there in the US? A LOT, thatâs how many. On a serious note, we hope that you recognize that being a software engineer is a great career option. (newline) The software development statistics donât lie: (newline) The talent shortage is no laughing matter. (newline) So, if you have an appreciation for engineering, developing or maintaining software we urge you to act on your appreciation and make a career out of it.

We unpack the qualifications for computer science jobs and look at where software engineers work. (newline) What Is a Software Engineer? (newline) Software engineers create web applications, mobile apps, robots, operating systems, and network systems. They develop software solutions that meet their companies' needs and expectations. Note that the terms "software engineer" and "software developer" are used interchangeably in the industry, but these positions' responsibilities vary slightly. (newline) Software engineers design software solutions, while software developers build those solutions to make them ready for consumers. Depending on the type of company they work for, software engineers will create original code for software and applications. They also build reusable code for future use. (newline) Read more about software engineers (newline) What a Software Engineer Does (newline) A standard day for a software engineer involves a lot of coding. These professionals rarely spend their day sitting at a desk fixing technical issues. At any given moment, a software engineer is managing several software projects, developing new code, and collaborating with coworkers to solve problems. (newline) Software engineers also spend time revising and rewriting other peopleâs code as needed. Building prototypes for clients is another common task. This entails understanding client expectations and developing prototypes accordingly. (newline) Software engineers do not always work independently. They collaborate with project managers, UI or UX designers, data scientists, and other team members. They also attend meetings and manage emails. (newline) Software engineers enjoy solving problems. They pay close attention to detail, since a small error can cause a program to collapse. (newline) Main Duties of Software Engineers (newline) System Design: (newline) System design involves defining the outline for web applications and products efficiently and clearly. These designs provide information and data in the coding framework for the software developer to make the product. (newline) Establish New Documentation: (newline) All new technology requires documentation for people to understand its functionality. This might look like creating or updating products and supporting documentation. The software engineer writes this supporting documentation. (newline) Maintain Software Functionality: (newline) Software engineers maintain existing software and create new software. This includes making updates to align with the latest industry and company standards, troubleshooting problems, and brainstorming future improvements. Maintenance is equally as important as writing new code. (newline) Troubleshoot and Upgrade Existing Systems: (newline) Along with maintaining existing systems, software engineers also troubleshoot problems when they arise. Both internal company systems and clients may need help solving problems. Software engineers also make updates as needed to ensure existing systems remain usable. (newline) Comply with Company and Industry Standards: (newline) Technology is a rapidly changing field. Products and systems must keep up with these changes. Software engineers usually oversee these updates. They must match industry trends and ensure their systems align with industry standards. (newline) Nonstandard Duties for Software Engineers (newline) Work with Clients: (newline) Many software engineers do not work directly with clients. However, working at a small company or startup can change this dynamic. If a software developer leads a project, they might regularly consult with the client to ensure the final product meets their expectations. (newline) Manage Internal Teams and Projects: (newline) Software engineers might manage internal teams and projects depending on the company and their roles. Experienced software engineers in a senior-level role at the company typically oversee teams. (newline) Interview and Hire for New Positions: (newline) If a new hire is being interviewed for their team, software engineers might speak with the job candidate to ensure a good fit. The final selection to fill roles usually falls on upper management. Still, a software engineerâs feedback is taken into consideration. (newline) Collaborate with Front-end Developers: (newline) Software engineers do not usually handle front-end development, but they might partner with front-end developers on some projects. In some cases, the front-end developer needs feedback from the software engineer to ensure they create a great product. (newline) Build Software with Code: (newline) A software engineer writes the code and creates the framework then a software developer executes the build. However, depending on the company and job description, software engineers might create new software with the developer. (newline) Top Online Programs (newline) Explore programs of your interests with the high-quality standards and flexibility you need to take your career to the next level. (newline) A Software Engineer's Typical Day (newline) A software engineerâs typical day begins either in the office or at home, if they work remotely. Each engineer is different. Their routine usually depends on their employer and personal work preferences. However, a typical day for a software engineer might look something like this: (newline) Software engineers start their day by working on their coding projects. Ideally, engineers set aside time every day to enter a âmental flowâ state, which allows them to focus on solving problems and developing reliable solutions. (newline) Software engineers may attend meetings interspersed throughout the day. The afternoon might involve reviewing emails and checking in with colleagues on shared projects. Engineers often meet with peers to ask questions or work through a project's challenging aspect before returning to their desk for more independent work. (newline) Reviewing and revising code is a good habit of software engineers. This task can occur in the afternoon before they wrap up their day. Software engineers conclude their workday between 5 and 6 p.m. (newline) Professional Spotlight: Sergii Zhuravel, Lead Software Engineer (newline) What previous computer science-related (or STEM) experience(s) did you have, if any, and what prompted your journey to become a software engineer? (newline) When I was learning applied mathematics and system analysis at university, I liked programming courses very much. After my graduation, I had a proposition to stay in the university as a teacher, but I decided to become a software engineer. (newline) If you specialize in a particular subject or work in a particular industry, what prompted this choice and/or how did it evolve? (newline) At first I started as a web developer, as it was very popular. But later, I also learned mobile development. I like everything in IT, so I usually learn what is required right now on the project and donât specialize in something particular. (newline) For whom do you think this career is a good fit? Why? (newline) I think everyone can become a software engineer. But of course, there are some skills or human traits that can make the learning process much easier and adoption to the profession much smoother. I think itâs good if one has good memory, for example, likes learning new stuff and can spend tons of time with a computer. (newline) ComputerScience.org is an advertising-supported site. Featured or trusted partner programs and all school search, finder, or match results are for schools that compensate us. This compensation does not influence our school rankings, resource guides, or other editorially-independent information published on this site. (newline) Match me with a bootcamp. (newline) Find programs with your skills, schedule, and goals in mind. (newline) MATCH ME TO A BOOTCAMP (newline) What educational path did you take to become a software engineer? Did you pursue additional education at any point? What was your educational experience like? (newline) I got a master's degree in applied mathematics, and this helped me to understand logic and programming easier. It took about five or six years for me. After that, I also spent 2-3 months learning Java myself, before I got my first job as a programmer. Today, there are a lot of different courses and bootcamps that can prepare a new developer in a few months, maximum in one year, I think. But I think that if possible, itâs better to get a decent education to have a good base in CS. (newline) What certifications or tests did you need to pass, if any, to enter the field and/or progress in your career? (newline) I had no certifications and didnât pass any tests when I got my first IT job. But during my career, I often take some courses and pass exams and tests. For example, right now Iâm preparing for the AWS exam to get an AWS developer associate certificate. (newline) How did you prepare for them? (newline) There are a lot of online courses on the internet. So, usually I prepare by taking some courses and reading books, then I practice a lot. (newline) What were they like? (newline) For example, I took a Scrum Master online course one time. I passed the course. I read a lot of additional materials (like the official scrum guide that is available on the internet). Then I passed simple tests during the course, and I got a certificate. (newline) What's a typical day like for you? (newline) In our company, we use Scrum (itâs very popular these days), so usually we start our day from the daily meeting. In the daily meeting, we discuss what we did yesterday, what we plan to do today, and do we have any issues/blockers or not. (newline) Then if I have some tasks in the tracking system, I work on the task or I pick a new one. I can communicate with the product owner or with a QA if I have any questions about requirements or if I have some ideas for improvements for the feature Iâm working on. (newline) When the feature is coded, I also work on the tests (unit tests mostly) because we try to have good test coverage. (newline) When the feature is ready, I publish it using Git to our repository (we use GitLab), and CI/CD tests the changes and publishes them to a Dev or QA environment, where our QA can test the feature or fix. If there is feedback from the QA that something doesnât work or works not as expected, I investigate the issue and fix it. (newline) Some days we have grooming sessions where we review existing tickets with features or bugs to better understand what we need to do and to be on the same page with all the team. (newline) What's your favorite part of being a software engineer? (newline) I think itâs a possibility to create something new every day. When you write the code, itâs like writing a poem. I mean that itâs a creation process and is very close to the art. And of course, itâs a âsuperpowerâ to solve problems. As a software engineer, you have a lot of tools that allow you to resolve a lot of different (and usually quite complex) problems, like sending starships to Mars. (newline) The most challenging part? (newline) I think for most people, itâs to keep motivated. Because a lot of times when we dream about complex problems, at work we can be asked just to program another form or spreadsheet. For me personally, I think the most challenging part is to keep the right balance between work and personal life. Working with the computer can take you fully and eat all your time. (newline) What advice do you have for individuals considering becoming a software engineer? (newline) Today is the best time to become a software engineer. If you really like this, jump into it. Itâs a cool profession that will give you a real superpower to solve complex problems. Who knows, maybe you will have the world. (newline) What do you wish you'd known before becoming a software engineer? (newline) If I knew that React would be so popular, I would invent it myself. I think nothing could change my desire to become a software engineer. But maybe it would be cool to know in advance what technologies (libraries, frameworks) will be popular in the future. Thatâs why I think there are a lot of articles on the Internet about âthe frameworks of the futureâ that try to predict what next libraries and frameworks will be built and will be popular. (newline) Sergii Zhuravel (newline) Sergii is a lead software engineer. He holds a master's degree in applied mathematics and more than 10 years of experience in IT. Sergii has worked with different back-end and front-end technologies. Now, he works mostly with the front end (for example, with React and Redux), which he enjoys a lot. He likes to share his knowledge, so he conducts programming courses (JavaScript), writes articles, and participates in different events, like hackathons. (newline) Where Software Engineers Work (newline) Software engineers find work at large corporations and startups or as freelancers. They can work at a standard tech company or in finance, software publishing, or manufacturing. Each of these industries requires software engineers, but most jobs are in computer systems design. (newline) Location is another factor for software engineers to consider. Software engineers can expect to find more lucrative job opportunities in large cities. According to the BLS, California has the highest number of software developer positions in the country, with 228,240 workers employed. Texas and Washington follow in second and third place. (newline) Most software developers work in Silicon Valley in California, earning a average annual salary of $146,770. Only Washington, mainly the Seattle area, pays their software developers a comparable wage ($ 145,150 annually on average). (newline) The BLS also reports that over 450,000 software developers work in computer systems design. The next highest industry is software publishing, with 133,340 workers. Each company has a unique culture that affects how software engineers work. These engineers might work independently with flexible hours or stay heavily involved in decisions with regular meetings.

The main principles of software engineering are designing, developing, testing, maintaining, and evaluating computer software.Â So, if youâre interested in software engineering statistics, this article will tell you everything you need to know. (newline) Top Software Engineering Statistics: Editorâs Choice (newline) There are (newline) 4.3 million (newline) software engineers in the US.One of the (newline) most famous software engineers (newline) is the creator of XML, Tim Bray.Only (newline) 10% (newline) of software engineers are part-time employees. (newline) 73% (newline) of software engineers have a bachelorâs degree.Only (newline) 22% (newline) of all software engineers are female. (newline) General Software Engineering Facts (newline) Software engineering is currently in high demand due to an ever-increasing need for new software and mobile applications. On the other hand, people are drawn to software engineering due to good salaries and low unemployment rates. Knowing all this, here are some general stats and facts about software engineers. (newline) 1. The average base software engineer salary in the US is $120,000 a year. (newline) The average additional cash compensation for a software engineer is $14,649, which makes the total compensation for a software engineer in the US $134,588. Furthermore, the lowest salaries for software engineers can be around $36,000, and the highest salaries can go up to $265,000 per year. (newline) 2. The unemployment rate for software engineers was only 1.9% in 2019. (newline) Other than a slight rise from 2014 to 2016, when the unemployment rate was 2.1% to 2.3%, the unemployment rate for software engineers has slowly been decreasing since 2010, when it stood at 4.6%. (newline) 3. As of 2021, there are 4.3 million software engineers in the US. (newline) The answer to âhow many software engineers are there in the USâ is a complicated one. The actual number is closer to 3.4 million people in the US because the 4.3 million we previously mentioned includes hardware engineers, CAD programmers, and others whose job is reading code on a daily basis. (newline) 4. The top-paying metropolitan area in the US is San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA, with an average annual salary of $145,730.

Tim Bray, who made the developerâs tool XML, is one of the most famous software engineers. (newline) While we canât say that there is a single best software engineer in the world, we can say for sure that this list has some of the best engineers the world has ever seen: (newline) Paul Buchheit developed the webmail service Gmail.John Carmack developed the computer games Doom and Quake.Dave Cutler developed Windows NT.Max Levchin created PayPal.Pierre Omidyar created eBay.Alexey Pazhitnov developed the computer game Tetris.Jimmy Wales made Wikipedia.Michael Widenius made the open-source database MySQL.Jamie Zawinski developed the web browser Netscape Navigator. (newline) If you want to know how an average person in the field lives, read about one day in the life of a software engineer. (newline) 11. There were over 26.2 million software developers in 2020. (newline) To further answer the question, âhow many software engineers are there in the world,â we have these stats that show that out of all software developers, 13.5 million were full-time devs, 7.8 million were part-time devs, and 4.9 million were non-compensated devs. This statistic also shows that application developers account for 72.3% of full-time and 26.2% of part-time developers. (newline) Conversely, infrastructure developers account for 27.7% of full-time and 73.8% of part-time developers. As of 2022, only 10% of software engineers are part-time employees. Therefore, as software engineering statistics show, a vast majority of software engineers work as full-time employees. (newline) 12. As of 2021, the most sought-after cloud platform is AWS, with 40.35% of devs expressing interest in using this technology. (newline) Google Cloud ranked second, with 22.6% of software developers wanting to work with it.

Employment for software engineers, developers, analysts, and testers is projected to grow by 22% from 2020 to 2030. (newline) This growth is much faster than the average for most other jobs. This means that the software engineer job growth and opportunities will be plentiful, with over 189,200 job positions for developers, testers, and analysts opening every year. Some job opportunities will result from people switching jobs or retiring. (newline) 15. The most sought-after software engineers are those that specialize in machine learning and data science. (newline) The demand for this specialization is very high, but there is a low talent supply. That means that if you specialize in machine learning and data science, it would be easy for you to find a job in the current market.

Software engineers are experts in the field of Computer Science and they use their knowledge to help businesses run by creating consumer-facing products and user-friendly systems. The path for how to become a software engineer is paved with education, technical ability, programming languages and more. (newline) We will take a look at what it takes to achieve your goal of becoming a software engineer, as well as how to plan ahead efficiently. (newline) Photo byÂ  Danial RiCaRoS Â onÂ  Unsplash (newline) What Does a Software Engineer Do? (newline) Software engineers take the electronic hardware of a computer and/or mobile device and makes it useful by employing computer engineering practices to design, develop and implement software that will run. Software engineers must first understand the business needs and then create the necessary programmed tools to achieve such goals. (newline) In practice, software engineers blend together their understanding and abilities in the realms of computer science, engineering, project management, and software development. From the creation of functioning programs to the testing, they ensure the userâs digital environment runs smoothly. (newline) The broad field can be broken down into two specializations, namely software development and applications development. Software and systems engineers use programming languages to develop functioning systems, whereas application developers code applications based on the userâs needs across various platforms, including desktops, laptops and mobile devices. (newline) Since the two specializations require different job duties, their average salaries are also slightly different. (newline) According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, their average salaries are as follows: (newline) Software Developers ( Applications ): $108,080 (newline) Software Developers ( Software ): $111,780 (newline) Become a Software Engineer (newline) The software engineering field is highly technical and specialized. As such, although there isnât a single way to accomplish the goal of working in the industry, the common path begins with formal education. (newline) 1. Study Computer Science (newline) A degree in Computer Science is a good place to start to begin your journey. You can choose to get your associateâs degree, bachelorâs degree or higher, depending on your career goals. (newline) Associateâs Degree: (newline) For entry-level positions, associateâs degrees will suffice and can be earned in about 2 years. The curriculum will provide you with the core foundational knowledge such as programming languages and modern ways to develop software. (newline) Bachelorâs Degree: (newline) For those seeking a position with any big or well-known company, a bachelorâs degree is often the minimum requirement. Bachelorâs degrees generally take 4 years to complete (if enrolled full-time). Along with the foundational knowledge that an associateâs degree offers, a bachelorâs degree will also provide coursework in mathematics, software testing and software architecture. (newline) Coding Bootcamp: (newline) For those who donât want to attend a formal institution or online university to receive a minimum of an associateâs degree, coding bootcamps exist. They offer intense training for the span of about 8-12 weeks, and upon graduating, students are meant to be prepared for entry-level positions in the field. (newline) Earning Your Degree: Online Options: (newline) Itâs important to note that your education level will impact your salary and likelihood of obtaining a job in the competitive field of software engineering. As such, itâs useful to weigh your costs and benefits of obtaining a degree. If financial constraints feel like they are a big part of your decision, you should know that you can always attend high-quality, accredited and online universities to pursue your dream of becoming a software engineer. (newline) For example, University of the People is a 100% online institution that offers associateâs and bachelorâs degrees in Computer Science that are tuition-free. (newline) The benefits of attending an online university include the flexibility of choosing when to study, the widened accessibility of having everything online and being able to study from anywhere in the world, and the lowered cost of obtaining your higher education degree. Additionally, online programs provide a simpler way to study part-time and continuing to manage preexisting responsibilities, whether it means raising a family or holding down a job, etc. (newline) 2. Start Programming and Building Software (newline) When you start programming, youâll have to choose which languages to learn. Depending on the type of products you want to create, one may be more useful than another. There are hundreds of programming languages out there to learn, but hereâs a quick look at some of the most popular: (newline) Java – Based on an object-oriented programming model, Java is intended to be easy to use. The language is used for complete applications that can be accessed from a single computer or network. (newline) Python – Python is used for computer software programming, as well as machine learning, browser automation, scientific computer, and robotics. (newline) C++ – C++ is a general purpose programming language that can be used for small programs or large applications. (newline) C# – C# is a general purpose programming language that is designed to create apps on the Microsoft platform. It is considered to be a blend of C and C++. (newline) PHP – PHP once stood for Personal Home Page, but now it stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. It can be embedded into HTML and was originally designed for web development. (newline) Once you have a grasp on programming languages, you can try your hand at developing and testing software or applications. These can serve as use cases to land an internship or showcase to a prospective client as part of your portfolio. (newline) 3. Get an Internship (newline) While youâre still in school, itâs always a good idea to get an internship to start making connections within the industry. Whether you choose to intern at a small startup or a well-established company, the internship will help make your resume stronger upon graduation and will expand your networking opportunities. (newline) Photo byÂ  HIVAN ARVIZU @soyhivan Â onÂ  Unsplash (newline) 4. Attend Conferences and Networking Events (newline) The industry is always evolving because technology and usersâ needs change. As such, itâs important to stay up-to-date with your knowledge of the field. Industry events and conferences can help provide you with information about new products, changing regulations, and best business practices. (newline) 5. Apply for Jobs (newline) Upon graduation or the culmination of a Coding Bootcamp, youâll want to create a killer CV or resume and start applying to positions that interest you. Thereâs always the option of continuing your education to earn a graduateâs degree, but with your undergraduate education and internship and coding experience, you should have accumulated enough examples of your work to secure a position in the field. (newline) The Bottom Line (newline) Software engineers are integral pieces of every industry. They bring software systems and applications into existence and ensure they are properly working and safe for users. Software engineers must be team players, have strong communication skills, be logical and solution-oriented, and are always willing to learn more. (newline) From earning your degree to creating products, networking, interning and ultimately landing a job in the field, software engineering will provide you with a lucrative and rewarding career.

After that came Microsoft, at $2.5 trillion, then Google (officially Alphabet) at $1.9 trillion, then Amazon at $1.5 trillion. (newline) On December 31, 2020, the four most valuable companies were: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. (newline) On December 31, 2019, the four most valuable companies were: Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. (newline) And on December 31, 2018, the four most valuable companies were: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google. (newline) If you’re anything like me, you’re starting to spot a pattern here. (newline) Revenue in software has grown from $400 billion in 2016 to $500 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $800 billion by 2026. (newline) Software has an increasing and overwhelming importance in our economy — and everything else in our society. High demand and low supply makes software engineering well-paid, and often enjoyable. (newline) But we also think that, if you’re trying to make the world a better place, software engineering could be a particularly good way to help. In a nutshell: Software engineering could be a great option for having a direct impact on the world’s most pressing problems. If you have good analytical skills (even if you have a humanities background), you might consider testing it. Basic programming skills can be easy to learn and extremely useful even if you decide not to go into software engineering, which means trying this out could be particularly low cost. ProsGain a flexible skillset.Make a significant direct impact, either by working on AI safety, or in otherwise particularly effective organisations.Have excellent working conditions, high pay, and good job security.ConsLate-stage earnings are often lower than in many other professional jobs (especially high-paying roles such as quantitative trading), unless you help found a successful startup.Likely only a small proportion of exceptional programmers will have a highly significant impact.Initially, it could be relatively challenging to gain skills quickly compared to some other jobs, as you need a particular concrete skillset.Key facts on fit Willingness to teach yourself, ability to break problems down into logical parts and generate and test hypotheses, willingness to try out many different solutions, high attention to detail, quantitative degree useful but not required. (newline) Sometimes recommended â personal fit dependent This career will be some peopleâs highest-impact option if their personal fit is especially good. Review status Based on an in-depth investigation (newline) This review owes a lot to helpful discussions with (and comments from) Andy Jones, Ozzie Gooen, Jeff Kaufman, Sasha Cooper, Ben Kuhn, Nova DasSarma, Kamal Ndousse, Ethan Alley, Ben West, Ben Mann, Tom Conerly, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, and George McGowan. Special thanks go to Roman Duda for our previous review of software engineering, on which this was based. Why might software engineering be high impact? Software engineers are in a position to meaningfully contribute directly to solving a wide variety of the world’s most pressing problems. (newline) In particular, there is a shortage of software engineers at the cutting edge of research into AI safety. (newline) We’ve also found that software engineers can contribute greatly to work aiming at preventing pandemics and other global catastrophic biological risks. (newline) Aside from direct work on these crucial problems, while working for startups or larger tech companies you can gain excellent career capital (especially technical skills), and, if you choose, earn and donate substantial amounts to the world’s best charities. How to do good as a software engineer Even for skilled engineers who could command high salaries, we think that working directly on a problem will probably be more impactful than earning to give. (newline) Some examples of projects where software engineering is central to their impactful work: (newline) Ought (newline) is an AI research lab attempting to build systems that apply machine learning to the task of helping people think.The (newline) Secure DNA Project (newline) is attempting to build a secure global screening system for DNA sequences that could be used to engineer a (newline) global pandemic . Momentum (newline) is a startup building donation pages that encourage recurring donations to the world’s (newline) most effective charities . Lightcone Infrastructure (newline) builds software-based infrastructure for (newline) longtermist (newline) projects. Telis Bioscience (newline) is a startup attempting to radically accelerate drug development to mitigate risks from future pandemics. Anthropic (newline) is a research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. Redwood Research (newline) conducts applied research into the (newline) challenge of aligning artificial intelligence . Wave (newline) is a startup building a way for people in developing countries to access financial services. Most organisations, even ones that don’t focus on developing large software products, need software engineers to manage computer systems, apps, and websites. For example: (newline) Effective Altruism Funds (newline) provides expert-managed funds to facilitate donors maximising the impact of their donations. They use software engineers to design and maintain their online platform. Our World in Data , founded by (newline) Max Roser , collects and presents data on many of the world’s most pressing problems. They use software engineers to maintain their website, analyse data, and develop their (newline) open-source data visualisation tool .Here at (newline) 80,000 Hours , (newline) our team (newline) includes two software engineers working on our website and other technology.The (newline) Centre for Effective Altruism ‘s tech team supports a variety of projects across the (newline) effective altruism community , such as the (newline) Effective Altruism Forum . Many people we’ve spoken to at these and other organisations have said that they have real difficulty hiring extremely talented software engineers. Many nonprofits want to hire people who believe in their missions (just as they do with operations staff), which indicates that talented, altruistic-minded software engineers are sorely needed and could do huge amounts of good. (newline) Smaller organisations that don’t focus on engineering often only have one or two software engineers. And because things at small organisations can change rapidly, they need unusually adaptable and flexible people who are able to maintain software with very little help from the wider team.1 (newline) It seems likely that, as the community of people working on helping future generations grows, there will be more opportunities for practical software development efforts to help. This means that even if you don’t currently have any experience with programming, it could be valuable to begin developing expertise in software engineering now. Software engineers can help with AI safety We’ve argued before that artificial intelligence could have a deeply transformative impact on our society. There are huge opportunities associated with this ongoing transformation, but also extreme risks — potentially even threatening humanity’s survival. (newline) With the rise of machine learning, and the huge success of deep learning models like GPT-3, many experts now think it’s reasonably likely that our current machine learning methods could be used to create transformative artificial intelligence. (newline) This has led to an explosion in empirical AI safety research, where teams work directly with deep neural networks to identify risks and develop frameworks for mitigating them. Examples of organisations working in empirical AI safety research include Redwood Research, DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic. (newline) These organisations are doing research directly with extremely large neural networks, which means each experiment can cost millions of dollars to run. This means that even small improvements to the efficiency of each experiment can be hugely beneficial. (newline) There’s also often overlap between experimental results that will help further AI safety and results that could accelerate the development of unsafe AI, so it’s also important that the results of these experiments are kept secure. (newline) As a result, it’s likely to remain incredibly valuable to have talented engineers working on ensuring that these experiments are as efficient and safe as possible. Experts we spoke to expect this to remain a key bottleneck in AI safety research for many years. (newline) However, there is a serious risk associated with this route: it seems possible for engineers to accidentally increase risks from AI by generally accelerating the technical development of the field. We’re not sure of the more precise contours of this risk (e.g. exactly what kinds of projects you should avoid), but think it’s important to watch out for. That said, there are many more junior non-safety roles out there than roles focused specifically on safety, and experts we’ve spoken to expect that most non-safety projects aren’t likely to be causing harm. If you’re uncertain about taking a job for this reason, our team may be able to help you decide. Software engineer salaries mean you can earn to give In general, if you can find a job you can do well, you’ll have a bigger impact working on a problem directly than you would by earning money and donating. However, earning to give can still be a high-impact option, especially if you focus on donating to the most effective projects that could use the extra funds. (newline) If you’re skilled enough to work at top companies, software engineering is a well-paid career. In the US, entry-level software engineer salaries start at around $110,000. Engineers at Microsoft start at $150,000, and engineers at Google start at around $180,000 (including stock and bonuses). If you’re successful, after a few years on the job you could be earning over $500,000 a year. (newline) Pay is generally much lower in other countries. Median salaries in Australia are around 20% lower than salaries in the US (approximately US$80,000), and around 40% lower in the UK, Germany, Canada, and Japan (approximately US$60,000). While much of your earnings as a software engineer come from bonuses and equity, rather than just your salary, these are also lower outside the US. (newline) If you do want to make a positive difference through donating part of your income as a software engineer, you may be able to increase your impact by using donation-matching programmes, which are common at large tech companies (although these are often capped at around US$10,000 per year). (newline) You can read more about salaries at large tech companies below. (newline) It’s important to note that many nonprofit organisations, including those focusing on AI safety, will offer salaries and benefits that compete with those at for-profit firms. (newline) If you work at or found a startup, your earnings will be highly variable. However, the expected value of your earnings — especially as a cofounder — could be extremely high. For this reason, if you’re a particularly good fit, founding a tech startup and donating your earnings could be hugely impactful, as you could earn and donate extraordinary amounts. What does a software engineering career involve? Ultimately, the best ways to have an impact with software engineering are probably things like working at an AI lab or a particularly effective nonprofit. (newline) To get there, there are two broad paths that you could follow to build software engineering skills (and, given the high salaries in software engineering, you can earn to give along the way): Working for a large, stable company (e.g. Microsoft, Google, Amazon)Working for a small, fast-growing startup In general, you will gain broadly transferable skills through either of these options. To gain experience as quickly and effectively as possible, look for roles that offer good management and mentorship opportunities. You should also make sure you gain a really deep understanding of the basics of software development. (newline) Working at a top-tier tech company also holds comparable prestige to working in finance or consulting, and gives you the opportunity to make connections with wealthy and influential people, many of whom are impact-minded and interested in doing good. (newline) You’ll need different skills, and work at different jobs, depending on whether you want to be a front-end, back-end (including machine learning), or full-stack developer. Working for a large software company The best way to develop software skills is to practise writing code and building software through years of experience. Direct one-on-one mentorship is extremely valuable when developing skills, and this is often provided through software engineering jobs at large tech companies. (newline) Top firms (e.g. Microsoft, Google, Amazon) are particularly good at providing training to develop particular skillsets, such as management and information security. After talking with people who have experience in training at both tech giants and elsewhere, we think that this internal training is likely the best way to develop knowledge in software engineering (other than on-the-job practice), and will be better than training provided outside of these big tech companies. (newline) However, it’s important to ensure that your role provides you with a variety of experiences: five years of software development experience is not the same as having the same year of experience five times over. (newline) For example, it can be harder to gain full-stack or transferable front-end development experience at a large company. Many large mature products have a large front-end team making many small tweaks and analysing their performance in experiments. This provides good training in experiment design and analysis, but often isn’t very transferable to the sorts of front-end work you’d do at smaller companies or nonprofits, where you’ll often be working in a much smaller team with a focus on developing the experience as a whole rather than running experiments on small changes. (newline) It generally takes around two years for new starters at big tech companies to have the experience they need to independently work on software, and another two years to reach a position where they are able to give advice and support to others in the company and manage projects. Key career stages at large tech companies First you’ll need some basic experience. You can get this from a relevant degree; working on a job at a smaller, less prestigious company; or from a bootcamp (see how to enter below for more). (newline) New graduates, and other people with a couple of years of relevant experience, will start out as junior engineers. As a junior engineer, you’d complete small, clearly specified tasks and gain a preliminary understanding of the software development lifecycle. You’ll generally be given lots of guidance and support from more experienced engineers. You usually stay in this role for around three years, gradually expanding your scope. In the US, you’d be paid an entry-level compensation of $100,000 to $200,000 (as of early 2022). (newline) Once you’ve successfully demonstrated that you can work on projects without needing much support, you’ll be given more responsibility. For a couple of years, you’ll work on more complex projects (often in one or two languages in which you’ve specialised), and with less support from others. (newline) After five to eight years2, you’ll generally progress to a senior engineer position. As a senior engineer, you write complex applications and have a deep understanding of the entire software lifecycle. You may lead small teams or projects, and you’ll be expected to provide mentorship and guidance to junior engineers. You can stay in this role for much of your career, though it becomes harder to compete with younger talent as you get older. Compensation in 2022 at this level is around $300,000 to $400,000 in the US. (newline) At this point you may have the skills to leave and become a technical founder or CTO of a startup. This is a highly variable option (since most startups fail), but could be one of the highest expected value ways to earn to give given a chance of wild success. (newline) Progressing past senior engineers, you’re typically responsible for defining as well as doing your job. You may go into management positions, or could become a staff engineer. Staff engineers, while still building software, also set technical direction, provide mentorship, input an engineering perspective to organisational decisions, and do exploratory work. At this level, at top firms in the US, you can earn upwards of $500,000 and sometimes more than $1,000,000 a year. (newline) Software engineering is unusual in that you can have a senior position without having to do management, and many see this as a unique benefit of the career. (To learn more about post-senior roles, we recommend The Staff Engineer’s Path by Tanya Reilly and the StaffEng website.) Working for a startup as a software engineer Working for a startup can give you a much broader range of experience, including problem-solving, project management, and other ‘soft’ skills — because unlike in large companies, there is no one else at the organisation to do these things for you. You can gain a strong understanding of the entire development process as well as general software engineering principles. (newline) Startups often have a culture that encourages creative thinking and resourcefulness. This can be particularly good experience for working in small software-focused nonprofits later in your career. (newline) However, the experience of working in small organisations varies wildly. You’ll be less likely to have many very senior experienced engineers around to give you the feedback you need to improve. At very small startups, the technical cofounder may be the only experienced engineer, and they are unlikely to provide the level of mentorship provided at big tech companies (in part because there’s so much else they will need to be doing). That said, we’ve spoken to some people who have had great mentorship at small startups. (newline) You also gain responsibility much faster at a fast-growing startup, as there is a desperate need for employees to take on new projects and gain the skills required. This can make startups a very fertile learning ground, if you can teach yourself what you need to know. (newline) Pay at startups is very variable, as you will likely be paid (in large part) in equity, and so your earnings will be heavily tied to the success of the organisation. However, the expected value of your earnings may be comparable to, and in some cases higher than, earnings at large companies. (newline) Many startups exit by selling to large tech companies. If this happens, you may end up working for a large company anyway. Moving to a direct impact software engineering roleWorking in AI safety If you are looking to work in an engineering role in an AI safety or other research organisation, you will probably want to focus on back-end software development (although there are also front-end roles, particularly those focusing on gathering data from humans on which models can be trained and tested). There are recurring opportunities for software engineers with a range of technical skills (to see examples, take a look at our job board). (newline) If you have the opportunity to choose areas in which you could gain expertise, the experienced engineers we spoke to suggested focusing on: Distributed systemsNumerical systemsSecurity In general, it helps to have expertise in any specific, hard-to-find skillsets. (newline) This work uses a range of programming languages, including Python, Rust, C++ and JavaScript. Functional languages such as Haskell are also common. (newline) We’ve previously written about how to move into a machine learning career for AI safety. We now think it is easier than we previously thought to move into an AI-safety-related software engineering role without explicit machine learning experience. (newline) The Effective Altruism Long-Term Future Fund and the Survival and Flourishing Fund may provide funding for promising individuals to learn skills relevant to helping future generations, including new technologies such as machine learning. If you already have software engineering experience, but would benefit from explicit machine learning or AI safety experience, this could be a good option for you. (newline) If you think you could, with a few weeks’ work, write a new feature or fix a bug in a major machine learning library, then you could probably apply directly for engineering roles at top AI safety labs (such as Redwood Research, DeepMind, OpenAI, and Anthropic), without needing to spend more time building experience in software engineering. These top labs offer pay that is comparable to pay at large tech firms. (newline) If you are considering joining an AI safety lab in the near future, our team may be able to help. Working on reducing global catastrophic biological risks Reducing global catastrophic biological risks — for example, research into screening for novel pathogens to prevent future pandemics — is likely to be one of the most important ways to help solve the world’s most pressing problems. (newline) Through organisations like Telis Bioscience and SecureDNA (and other projects that might be founded in the future), there are significant opportunities for software engineers to contribute to reducing these risks. (newline) Anyone with a good understanding of how to build software can be useful in these small organisations, even if they don’t have much experience. However, if you want to work in this space, you’ll need to be comfortable getting your hands dirty and doing whatever needs to be done, even when the work isn’t the most intellectually challenging. For this reason, it could be particularly useful to have experience working in a software-based startup. (newline) Much of the work in biosecurity is related to handling and processing large amounts of data, so knowledge of how to work with distributed systems is in demand. Expertise in adjacent fields such as data science could also be helpful. (newline) There is also a big focus on security, particularly at organisations like SecureDNA. (newline) Most code in biosecurity is written in Python. (newline) If you’re interested in working on biosecurity and pandemic preparedness as a software engineer, you can find open positions on our job board. Other important direct work Nonprofit organisations and altruistic-minded startups often have very few team members. And no matter what an organisation does, they almost always have some need for engineers (for example, 80,000 Hours is not a software organisation, but we employ two developers). So if you find an organisation you think is doing something really useful, working as a software engineer for them might be an excellent way to support that work. (newline) Engineering for a small organisation likely means doing work across the development process, since there are few other engineers. (newline) Often these organisations are focused on front-end development, with jobs ranging from application development and web development to data science and project management roles. There are often also opportunities for full-stack developers with a broad range of experience. (newline) Founding an organisation yourself is more challenging, but can be even more impactful. And if you’ve worked in a small organisation or a startup before, you might have the broad skills and entrepreneurialism that’s required to succeed. See our profile on founding new high-impact projects for more. Reasons not to go into software engineering We think that most people with good general intelligence will be able to do well at software engineering. And because it’s very easy to test out (see the section on how to predict your fit in advance), you’ll be able to tell early on whether you’re likely to be a good fit. (newline) However, there are lots of other paths that seem like particularly promising ways to help solve the world’s most pressing problems, and it’s worth looking into them. If you find programming difficult, or unenjoyable, your personal fit for other career paths may be higher. And even if you enjoy it and you’re good at it, we think that will be true for lots of people, so that’s not a good reason to think you won’t be even better at something else! (newline) As a result, it’s important to test your fit for a variety of options. Try taking a look at our other career reviews to find out more. How much do software engineers earn? It’s difficult to make claims about software engineer earnings in general. (newline) For a start, almost all of the official (especially government) data on this is on salaries rather than total compensation. By the time you’re a senior engineer, less than half of what you earn will be from your salary — the rest will be from bonuses, stock, and other benefits. (newline) Most government data also reports median salaries, but as we saw when looking at progression in big tech firms, very senior software engineers can earn seven-figure compensations. So we should expect the distribution of total compensation to be positively skewed, or possibly even bimodal. (newline) As a result, you should think of the figures below as representing salaries for early- to mid- career software developers. (newline) Even given all these caveats, the figures we present here are instructive for understanding the relative salary levels (e.g. between locations), even if the absolute values given aren’t perfect. (newline) More data is available at Levels.fyi, which collects data from people self-reporting their total compensation, and also has data on the distribution of what people earn, rather than just averages. Software engineering salaries in the US Here are the median US salaries for software developers, from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics: (newline) Median US salaries for software engineers in 2020 (excluding bonuses)3  MeanMedianComputer programmers$95,640$89,190Software developers and software quality assurance analysts and testers$114,270$110,140Web developers and digital interface designers$85,490$77,200 (newline) Here are the median salaries at different levels of progression, both in the US as a whole and in Mountain View and Palo Alto (i.e. Silicon Valley).4 In general, salaries rise quite rapidly in the early stages of the career, but then level off and grow by only a few percent per year after around a decade. However, this is probably offset by increases in other forms of compensation. (newline) Median US salaries for software engineers in 2020 at different levels of progression StageUsual experience requiredUS (median salary + bonus)Mountain View and Palo Alto, CA (median salary + bonus)Software engineer I (entry level)0-2 years$75,000$94,000Software engineer II2-4 years$95,000$120,000Software engineer III4-6 years$120,000$150,000Software engineer IV6-8 years$147,000$185,000Software engineer V8-10 years$168,000$211,000Software engineering manager10+ years$155,000$195,000Software engineer director10+ years$226,000$284,000Software engineer director15+ years$303,000$380,000 (newline) For figures on total compensation, especially at top companies, we can again look at Levels.fyi. These figures are far higher. Entry-level compensation is around $150,000, rising to $300,000 to $400,000 for senior engineers, and above $500,000 for late-career engineers. The top compensation levels reported are over $1,000,000. (newline) Salaries also vary by location within the US; they are generally significantly higher in California (although web developers are best paid in Seattle). (newline) Mean salary by US region in 20205  NationalTop-paying stateTop-paying metro areaComputer programmers$95,640$107,300 (CA)$125,420 (San Francisco)Software developers and software quality assurance analysts and testers$114,270$137,620 (CA)$157,480 (Silicon Valley)Web developers and digital interface designers$85,490$94,960 (WA)$138,070 (Seattle) (newline) These data are supported by Levels.fyi data on various locations in the US (e.g. Atlanta, New York City, Seattle, and the Bay Area). (newline) Notably, the differences between locations in salaries at the 90th percentile is much higher than the differences in median salaries.

(In general, data on average cost of living is particularly representative of the costs you’d expect to pay if you have a family or want to own a house.) (newline) If you want to estimate your own disposable income given different scenarios, you can try these tools: (newline) Estimate your post-tax income (newline) Find out the cost of living in different cities (newline) Calculate your donatable income Software engineering pay in other countries Software engineers are paid significantly less outside the US. The UK Office for National Statistics found that the mean salary for “programmers and software development professionals” in 2020 was Â£46,000 (US$59,000 in 2020).8 Even when looking at full compensation, we see similar trends across the world.

For example, US immigration law mandates that a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas (one of the most common types for software engineers) are issued a year. Also, because of the cost of flying you out for an interview, there will often be a higher bar for international applicants passing phone interviews. (newline) There are some things that can make it easier to get a visa: Having a degree in computer science or other field related to your jobApplying to companies with enough capital and flexibility to bear the time and financial costs of the visa processHaving a specific unusual skillset that may be hard to find in the US Take a look at this blog to find out more. (newline) Despite all of this, remote work in software development is becoming far more common. There’s a growing trend for a few companies to hire globally for remote roles, and pay US-market compensation. If you manage to get one of those roles, you can earn a lot from anywhere. Software engineering job outlook The future demand for software engineers is promising. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 22% growth in US employment of software engineers from 2020â30, which is much higher than the growth rate for all occupations (8%). The main reason given for this growth is a large projected increase in the demand for software for mobile technology, the healthcare industry, and computer security. (newline) The number of web development jobs is projected to grow by 13% from 2020â2030. The main reasons for this are the expected growth of e-commerce and an increase in mobile devices that access the web. (newline) What does this mean for future salaries? Strong growth in demand provides the potential for salary growth, but it also depends on how easily the supply of engineers can keep up with demand. (newline) Software engineering job satisfaction The same high demand for software engineers that leads to high pay also leads to high bargaining power. As a result, job satisfaction among software engineers is high. (newline) Many software engineers we have spoken to say the work is engaging, often citing the puzzles and problems involved with programming, and being able to enter a state of flow (which is one of the biggest predictors of job satisfaction). On the other hand, working with large existing codebases and fixing bugs are often less pleasant. Read our five interviews with software engineers for more details. (newline) Work-life balance in software engineering is generally better than in jobs with higher or comparable pay. According to one survey, software engineers work 8.6 hours per day (though hours are likely to be longer in higher-paid roles and at startups). (newline) Tech companies are progressive, often having flexible hours, convenient perks, remote working, and a results-driven culture. The best companies are widely regarded as among the best places to work in the world. Examples of people pursuing this path (newline) Nova DasSarma Nova decided to move into software engineering — specifically large-scale systems architecture — when she realised she wasn’t a good fit for the lab benchwork she needed to do for her major in bioinformatics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. (newline) After moving through various institutions and startups (originally focusing on work in computational biology), Nova realised that, through her focus on high-compute infrastructure, she had built a unique and important skillset for working on AI safety. With funding from Open Philanthropy, she cofounded Hofvarpnir Studios, a nonprofit providing support and GPU clusters for AI safety researchers. While working at Hofvarpnir, she is now also a Senior Systems Infrastructure Engineer at Anthropic, an AI safety research company.

But he found that our applied practical research into careers was more different from writing philosophy essays than he had anticipated. As a result, he decided to teach himself programming and has been a software engineer at 80,000 Hours since 2018. (newline) He has continued to learn as much as he can and went to a Codeworks software engineering bootcamp in 2021. He found that he was a much better fit for software engineering than research — in part because of the rapid feedback loops common in software roles — and was surprised by how useful he has continued to be at 80,000 Hours as a software engineer. How to predict your fit in advance The best way to gauge your fit is to try it out. You don’t need a computer science degree to do this. We recommend that you: (newline) Try out writing code (newline) — as a complete beginner, you can write (newline) a Python program (newline) in less than 20 minutes that reminds you to take a break every two hours. Once you know the fundamentals, try taking an (newline) intro to computer science and programming (newline) class, or (newline) work through free resources . If you’re in college, you could try taking CS 101 (or an equivalent course outside the US). Do a project with other people (newline) — this lets you test out writing programs in a team and working with larger codebases. It’s easy to come up with programming projects to do with friends — you can see some examples (newline) here . (newline) Contributing to open-source projects (newline) in particular lets you work with very large existing codebases. Take an internship or do a (newline) coding bootcamp (newline) . It seems likely that a few software engineers could be significantly better than average. These very best software engineers are often people who spend huge amounts of time practising. This means that if you enjoy coding enough to want to do it both as a job and in your spare time, you are likely to be a good fit. How to enter this field While a degree in computer science or a quantitative subject is often helpful, many entry-level jobs don’t require one, meaning that software engineering is open to people with backgrounds in humanities and social sciences. (newline) To enter, you need some basic programming skills and to be able to demonstrate a strong interest in software engineering. We’ve seen many people with humanities and social science degrees get junior software engineer jobs with high salaries, just through learning on their own or through coding bootcamps. Learning to program Basic computer programming skills can be extremely useful whatever you end up doing. You’ll find ways to automate tasks or analyse data throughout your career. This means that spending a little time learning to code is a very robustly useful option. (newline) Learning on your own. (newline) There are many great introductory computer science and programming courses online, including: (newline) Udacity’s Intro to Computer Science , (newline) MIT’s Introduction to Computer Science and Programming , and (newline) Stanford’s Programming Methodology . Don’t be discouraged if (newline) your code doesn’t work the first time (newline) — that’s what normally happens when people code! Attending a coding bootcamp. (newline) We’ve advised many people who managed to get junior software engineer jobs in less than a year through going to a bootcamp. Coding bootcamps are focused on taking people with little knowledge of programming to as highly paid a job as possible within a couple of months. This is a great entry route if you don’t already have much background, though some claim the long-term prospects are not as good because you lack a deep understanding of computer science. (newline) Course Report (newline) is a great guide to choosing a bootcamp. Be careful to avoid (newline) low-quality bootcamps . To find out more, (newline) read our interview with an App Academy instructor . Studying computer science at university (or another subject involving lots of programming). (newline) If you’re in university, this is a great option because it allows you to learn programming while the opportunity cost of your time is lower. It will also give you a better theoretical understanding of computing than a bootcamp will (which can be useful for getting the most highly paid and intellectually interesting jobs), a good network, some prestige, and a better understanding of lower-level languages like C. Having a CS degree also makes it easier to get a US work visa if you’re not from the US. Doing internships. (newline) If you can find internships, ideally at your target employers (whether big tech companies or nonprofits), you’ll gain practical experience and the (newline) key skills you otherwise wouldn’t pick up (newline) from academic degrees (e.g. using version control systems and powerful text editors).Getting your first job in software engineering Larger companies will broadly advertise entry-level roles. For smaller companies, you may have to reach out directly and through your network. You can find startup positions on job boards such as AngelList, and many top venture capital firms have job boards for their portfolio companies. (newline) Large software firms can have long and in-depth interview processes. You will be asked about general software knowledge, and later rounds of interviews are likely to give you problems around coding and algorithms, during which you will be asked to collaborate with the interviewer to solve the problem. (newline) It’s worth practising software engineering interview questions in advance; often this means apply for companies you are less likely to want to work at first, and use these applications to get used to the process. This can be a stressful process (in part because you might face some early rejections, in part because it’s tricky to navigate applying if you don’t really want the job that much), so it’s important to take care of your mental health throughout the process. (newline) It will also probably help to study the most popular interview guide, Cracking the Coding Interview. You can also practise by doing TopCoder problems. (newline) We think that this guide to getting a software engineering job is particularly helpful. There are six rough steps: (newline) Send a company your resume. (newline) Make it as specific as possible to the job you’re applying for, and proofread it carefully. If you can get a referral from a friend, that will significantly increase your chances of success. Speak to a recruiter. (newline) Read up about the company in advance, and make sure you have questions. Be nice — it’s going to help if the recruiter is on your side. Have a technical phone interview. (newline) You’ll solve some problems together. Make sure you ask questions to clarify the problem, and strategise about the best possible approach before you start writing code. Finish by checking for bugs and make sure you’re handling errors correctly. When you’re done, ask the interviewer some questions! Have a three- to six-hour on-site interview. (newline) It’s key to talk out loud as you work through a problem. And again, ask your interviewer some questions about them and the company. Get an offer from the recruiter. (newline) You should make sure they think you are seriously considering the company or you may not get an offer. If you don’t get an offer, ask for feedback (though it’s not always possible for companies to give detailed feedback). If you need more time to think (or to apply elsewhere), tell them in advance, and they may choose to wait to give you details when you’re more ready to go through with an offer. Accept the offer!

What Does a Software Engineer Do? | Codecademy (newline) Blog home (newline) Career advice (newline) Learning tips (newline) Course updates (newline) News (newline) Business (newline) Published 14 October 2020 (newline) / Updated 7 November 2022 (newline) / (newline) Career Advice (newline) What Does a Software Engineer Do? (newline) Interested in learning more about what software engineers do? By definition, software engineers build digital products, database programs, and computer systems for businesses by applying different kinds of programming languages to user-focused applications. (newline) But to give you a better picture of what it's like to work as a software engineer, we spoke with Xavier, a Senior Software Engineer here at Codecademy. Xavier works on our Conversion team, which is responsible for improving the experience for learners that visit the Codecademy site for the first time. (newline) In our interview, Xavier talks about some of the common misconceptions about working as a software engineer, and the difference between programmers, developers, and engineers. Plus, he shares what he loves most about his job in software engineering. Check out the video interview below and then read on to learn more. What is a Software Engineer? Many people believe that software engineers just sit in front of a computer and write lines of code for eight hours every day. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. Xavier tells us: (newline) Most developers create applications with the user experience in mind. Behind the scenes, they have to juggle multiple software projects and consult with their coworkers on how things should be done instead of just coding the entire time. (newline) Software engineers work in collaboration with designers, data scientists, and project managers to figure out how to best create and support their processes and projects. They're also generally in charge of reviewing other people's code, meeting with team members, and doing a healthy amount of research. (newline) Another important part of the job is identifying what the client needs, designing a prototype of the product, and developing a functional piece of software. After that, they have to run tests on the software to see if there are any existing bugs to remove. The final product is then released and made available to end-users. (newline) You could say itâs a group effort â software engineers collaborate with project managers, UI/UX designers, data scientists, and subject-matter experts every step of the way. Of course, we canât overlook the interpersonal aspects, either, such as training developers to debug software or asking users to test apps for them. What is the difference between a software engineer, programmer, and web developer? If you're thinking about a job in coding, you've likely seen a variety of titles for roles in the field â software engineer, programmer, web developer. There's definitely a lot of overlap between these roles. (newline) As Xavier mentions, you may find, during your job search and throughout your career journey, that some companies will use different names to refer to the same roles. For instance, some companies will refer to their programmers as web developers or front-end engineers, while others prefer to call them software or UI engineers. (newline) There are a few ways to spot the differences among software engineer, web developer, and programmer roles. (newline) Web developers are focused on creating browser apps with a combination of client-side and server-side programming languages. Generally speaking, they are involved in designing interactive websites and building user-facing applications. (newline) Software engineers are more likely to work on computer systems as a whole. They develop standalone programs and apps to help users perform various activities. For the most part, they program, document, test, and maintain software by utilizing the best practices in DevOps. (newline) Although their job descriptions may slightly differ, they do still fall under the same development umbrella. (newline) The only real distinction you have to make is the one between front-end and back-end programming â whether youâre designing surface-level UI and user-centric applications or running hidden processes inside a database server. (newline) But no matter what your title, Xavier says, "At the end of the day, we're all trying to solve business problems with code." Software engineers, programmers, and web developers are all solving challenging, real-world problems using programming languages. Software Engineers vs. Software Developers When you're looking for a job, you might see postings for Software Developers and Software Engineers. The difference is mostly semantic nowadays, and many companies don't distinguish between the two. But generally, engineering roles require knowledge of and experience with a broader scope of domains that includes development infrastructure: the tools and systems for building software. (newline) Software Engineers are tasked with approaching development from a more holistic perspective and contributing more to research and testing than Software Developers. Because they tend to have more duties, Software Engineers may earn higher salaries. Data shows that Software Engineers average $122,867 in the U.S. while Software Developers earn $95,625 on average. Why being a software engineer is rewarding We asked Xavier about what he loves about his job as a software engineer and about coding. He shared three things â the flow state he gets into when coding, the way that code helps to solve real-world problems, and fact that there's a lot of demand for software engineers. The flow state Xavier shared that one of his favorite things is the flow state he gets into while coding. "When you're coding, you're thinking of very abstract, hard problems and you don't have time to think about other things. You become hyper-focused on the task at hand, and it's just a very empowering, very creative pursuit." You're improving the world "By writing code, you're actually solving real problems in the world," says Xavier. It's hard to see when you're in the code â you're just in that flow state, having fun. But as soon as you're done, you're putting that code out there and you're solving a very complicated business problem for millions of people. There's a lot you can do with tech, and code in particular, when it comes to having an impact on the world.There's a ton of demand for it Finally, Xavier shares that he likes that there's a lot of demand for software. "I can support myself and my family for years to come, based on the skills that I've learned." (newline) The job outlook for software engineers is quite promising, due to an increasing demand for technology solutions. And that probably wonât change anytime soon â the demand for software engineers is projected to rise by 15% over the next decade. They are highly sought after by companies for their systematic approach to software development, where every product must fulfill the needs of the client. Advice for budding software engineers Considering a career in software engineering? We asked Xavier if he had any advice for those that are just starting out. His biggest piece of advice is to take initiative: In school you learn to do things the way your teacher might tell you how to do them. But, in business, there's no one telling you how to do things.I would encourage people to take initiative in finding solutions to problems they're not even asked to find; to take initiative in reaching out to people; to feel confident in asking a lot of questions. Try to take initiative in everything you do. The opportunities will find you if you reach out and try to solve different problems for different people. Xavier offers up even more tips and advice on his website in an article on How to Stand Out as an Entry-Level Software Engineer. How to become a Software Engineer If Xavier's interview was inspiring to you, a career in software engineering may be in your future â and you can get started right here on Codecademy! (newline) First, you'll want to figure out what kind of Software Engineer you want to be, so do some research. Read about some of the cool jobs in tech; explore salary expectations and demand across industries.

Software quality assurance analysts and testers identify problems with applications or programs and report defects. (newline) Work Environment (newline) Many software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers work in computer systems design and related services, in manufacturing, or for software publishers. They often work in offices and on teams with other software developers or quality assurance analysts and testers. (newline) How to Become a Software Developer, Quality Assurance Analyst, or Tester (newline) Software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers typically need a bachelor’s degree in computer and information technology or a related field. Some employers prefer to hire developers who have a master’s degree. (newline) Pay (newline) The median annual wage for software developers was $120,730 in May 2021. (newline) The median annual wage for software quality assurance analysts and testers was $98,220 in May 2021. (newline) Job Outlook (newline) Overall employment							of software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers is projected to grow							 25 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. (newline) About 162,900 openings for software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers are projected each year, on average, over the decade. (newline) Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire. (newline) State & Area Data (newline) Explore resources for employment and wages by state and area for software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers. (newline) Similar Occupations (newline) Compare the job duties, education, job growth, and pay of software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers with similar occupations.

(newline) What They Do -> (newline) What Software Developers, Quality Assurance Analysts, and Testers Do (newline) About this section (newline) Developers create diagrams that help programmers write computer code. (newline) Software developers create the computer applications that allow users to do specific tasks and the underlying systems that run the devices or control networks. Software quality assurance analysts and testers design and execute software tests to identify problems and learn how the software works. (newline) Duties (newline) Software developers typically do the following: (newline) Analyze users’ needs and then design and develop software to meet those needs (newline) Recommend software upgrades for customers’ existing programs and systems (newline) Design each piece of an application or system and plan how the pieces will work together (newline) Create a variety of models and diagrams showing programmers the software code needed for an application (newline) Ensure that a program continues to function normally through software maintenance and testing (newline) Document every aspect of an application or system as a reference for future maintenance and upgrades (newline) Software quality assurance analysts and testers typically do the following: (newline) Create test plans, scenarios, and procedures for new software (newline) Identify project risks and recommend steps to minimize those risks (newline) Implement software testing, using either manual or automated programs and exploratory testing, and evaluate results (newline) Document and report defects or problems with software (newline) Provide feedback to software developers and stakeholders regarding usability and functionality (newline) Software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers are involved in the entire process of creating a software program. Developers may begin by asking how the customer plans to use the software so that they can identify the core functionality the user needs. Software developers also determine other requirements, such as security. They design the program and then work closely with programmers, who write computer code. However, some developers write code themselves instead of giving instructions to programmers. (newline) Software quality assurance analysts and testers design and execute systems to check the software for problems. As part of their testing, these workers document and track the software’s potential defects or risks. They also assess its usability and functionality to identify difficulties a user might have. After completing testing, they report the results to software or web developers and review ways to solve any problems they found. (newline) After the program is released to the customer, a developer may perform upgrades and maintenance. Quality assurance analysts and testers run manual and automated checks to look for errors and usability problems once the software is released and after any upgrades or maintenance. (newline) The following are examples of types of software developers: (newline) Applications software developers design computer applications, such as games, for consumers. They may create custom software for a specific customer or commercial software to be sold to the general public. Some applications software developers create databases or programs for use internally or online. (newline) Software engineers take a broad view of a project’s system and software requirements, planning its scope and order of work. These workers may direct software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers. (newline) Systems software developers create the operating systems for the public or specifically for an organization. These operating systems keep computers functioning and control most of the consumer electronics in use today, including those in cell phones and cars. Often, systems software developers also build the interface that allows users to interact with the computer. (newline) Developers who supervise a software project from the planning stages through implementation sometimes are called information technology (IT) project managers.

What Do Software Engineers Do? - Trio Developers (newline) Home (newline) Hiring (newline) Management (newline) Engineering (newline) Talk To Us (newline) Services (newline) Staff Augmentation (newline) Distributed Team (newline) Resources (newline) Blog (newline) Podcast (newline) Inside Trio (newline) About Trio (newline) Careers (newline) Home (newline) Staff Augmentation (newline) Distributed Team (newline) About Trio (newline) Careers (newline) Blog (newline) Podcast (newline) Hiring (newline) Management (newline) Engineering (newline) Hiring (newline) What Do Software Engineers Do? (newline) Daniel Alcanja (newline) â¢ (newline) 7 min read (newline) These days you probably hear âSilicon Valleyâ and âMark Zuckerburgâ so much they feel like vocab words. But itâs not just about the glamour. Software engineers have a drastic impact on how you and just about everyone else run their day-to-day lives. (newline) From Facebook to TikTok to your preferred word processor whether that be Google Docs or Microsoft Word, software engineers often help people connect with others and the space they occupy when it would otherwise be very difficult. (newline) Technology plays a large part in how humans navigate the world. While older generations often criticize the technology itself, human people â also known as software engineers â bear much of the responsibility for these tools. (newline) And no matter what boomers might say, there are some objectively wholesome if not powerful things that can be accomplished with technology like reaching out to loved ones or spreading an important message. (newline) Keeping all this in mind, you might be wondering what exactly software engineers do? Keep reading to find out. (newline) What Is the Role of a Software Engineer? (newline) Software engineering is a branch of computer science that includes developing software and computer systems. Typically, writing code or programming is a large part of the development process. Through programming, software engineers can design anything from games to operating systems. (newline) To do this, professional software engineers will have mastery of several programming languages, depending on which ones they prefer or which ones are most in-demand in the industry. (newline) Most recently, the most popular programming languages include C, Java, and Python, according to the September Tiobe Index which measures popularity based on major search engines. (newline) Of course, the programming languages a software engineer uses can largely differ depending on the specific type of work they do. (newline) Software engineers who develop mobile apps, for example, generally have a much narrower range of programming languages available to them. Swift is a programming language for developing iOS apps but it cannot be used outside of that niche. (newline) The development process is also much more than programming alone. Making sure code is functional and user-friendly is just as important. (newline) What Does a Software Engineer Do? (newline) A software engineer does a number of things each day that ultimately culminate in building a software product. The specific day-to-day tasks of a software engineer include but are not limited to the following: (newline) constantly communicating with the client to pinpoint specifications and software needs for the user (newline) collaborating with other software engineers and divvying up roles and responsibilities accordingly (newline) creating algorithms, models, and prototypes to better comprehend how to construct clean, maintainable code (newline) writing, testing, and debugging code, ensuring that it is fully functional and bug-free (newline) documenting procedures in order for future software engineers and other involved parties to streamline development processes (newline) performing regular maintenance on the application and carrying out updates as needed (newline) Quite a few of these tasks revolve around the notion of effective communication. In fact, if this wasnât part of the process then software would be essentially useless. (newline) While itâs important to have a software engineer who has expertise when it comes to technical skills, having soft skills are similarly crucial in the development process. (newline) Related reading: Software Developers vs. Software Engineers - Whatâs the Difference? (newline) Why Is Software Engineering Important? (newline) Software engineers have a direct role in building nearly every single great technology that humans know and use today. This sounds quite dramatic; but itâs true. Without software engineers, youâd be living in a pre-50s era science fiction movie. (newline) Humans these days use smartphones as an extension of their bodies. And the apps, user interface (UI), operating system, and all else of smartphones are developed by software engineers. (newline) Just about every person you know uses Netflix or Spotify for some quality downtime. These streaming services are due to software engineers as well. (newline) Even the hermit who has distanced themselves from all technologies might need to pick up some food at their local grocery store. Well, contemporary cash registers rely on software engineering too. (newline) Clearly, itâs impossible if not very difficult to not give software engineers credit for their influence on the world. Letâs not underestimate their importance. Now keep scrolling and donât forget that software engineers developed this website too. (newline) What Are the Different Types of Software Engineers (newline) Software engineers, alternatively called software developers, can be split up into two principal categories: applications software developers and systems software developers. (newline) Applications Software Developers (newline) Applications software developers build software that is client-focused. Most of the applications and websites you use were and are maintained by applications software developers. (newline) Web developers and mobile developers fall under this definition as well as graphical user interface (GUI) developers who build the UI from which users interact directly with computer functions. (newline) The end-user plays a large part in the role of an application software developer as their work always caters to whoever will be accessing the application on a regular basis. Application software developers work on both front-end and back-end development. (newline) Systems Software Developers (newline) Systems software developers are sometimes called systems engineers or systems developers. Much of their role consists of back-end development. They build large systems and work closely with hardware. (newline) Operating systems and networks are developed by systems software engineers. Applications software developers build user-facing applications that must work with these operating systems and networks. (newline) As systems developers manage hardware needs as well, they tend to have careers in information technology (IT) and enforce IT standards. (newline) 7 Qualities That Make a Great Software Engineer (newline) As technology evolves, the demand for software engineering remains high and it doesnât look like it will decrease any time soon. Software engineers have evolved from building IT products to problem-solvers that address complex business and social challenges and develop essential solutions. (newline) It is a popular career choice, not only because it has promising growth and high pay, but because it can be fulfilling in many ways. You get to change the world with your work, fix problems, and impact peopleâs lives. (newline) The market is full of good professionals, but what skills and abilities separate great software engineers from good ones? (newline) 1. Great software engineers are open-minded. (newline) Software engineering is a process and not a set of rules written in stone. Being able to hear other peopleâs opinions, accept new ideas and technologies while not getting hung up on one thing leads to better engineering overall. (newline) You may not always agree with your team members, but listening to their ideas and trying to understand before giving judgment will give you a chance to look at the problem from a different angle and come up with a viable solution. (newline) 2. Great software engineers have a team mindset. (newline) A good software engineer has high-level skills; a great software engineer should know that software development is a collaborative process and requires more than skill. This is not limited to leadership skills but implies overall teamwork. (newline) Every victory and failure is the result of teamwork. Knowing how to make the team cooperate and align with the same goals defines a great engineer. (newline) 3. Great software engineers are able to give and be receptive to constructive feedback. (newline) A great engineer can distinguish between constructive feedback and baseless criticism. They also know how to communicate their opinions in a way that will be heard and understood. (newline) Feedback is a crucial part of engineering. Itâs the most direct way of figuring out what is working for the client and the team and what is not. The software development process often needs to be adjusted and calibrated for the project to be completed in the right way and in the given timeframe. (newline) 4. Great engineers make data-driven decisions. (newline) Putting personal preferences aside and leading the decision-making process with data is the only way of knowing what is best for the project and your clientâs business. (newline) Personal judgment and ideas are great, but they need to be supported by data or experience to prove themselves worthy. Informed data-driven decisions help to minimize risks and optimize processes in the project. (newline) 5. Great engineers balance perfectionism and pragmatism. (newline) Too much of either perfectionism or pragmatism can hurt the workflow. Finding the right balance of both will curb many problems that may arise in the software development process. (newline) In the end, this balance will result in a high-quality product. Great software engineers aim high but remember to keep their feet on the ground. (newline) 6. Great engineers have an aptitude for business. (newline) When you are developing a product, you are developing it for the end-user. Understanding the audience that will use the product and how they use it is vital for making sure the product fits the userâs needs as well as business goals and requirements. (newline) Sometimes an app that looks perfect on the paper just wonât click with people. Behaviour is often driven by emotions, not logic. A great software engineer knows how to create a product that will satisfy both the end-user and the clientâs business needs. (newline) 7. Great engineers carry a healthy skepticism. (newline) Hope for the best but prepare for the worst. A great programmer knows to test and inspect every part of the program before trusting it. (newline) Where a good programmer may ignore an imperfection, a great one will make sure that it doesnât cause a bigger problem in the future by addressing it immediately. (newline) How To Hire Software Engineers (newline) Hiring software engineers starts with having a good grasp of what youâd require a software engineer to do for your business. Run with this idea and write a good job description to attract potential candidates on job networks. Hereâs what to do: (newline) Intro paragraph: (newline) Your intro paragraph serves as an introduction to your company and a general summary of what youâre looking for. Try to mention what the goal or mission of your business is. Tell the candidate about the mobile app youâre building that will make life so much more convenient or how your website will allow easy access to the self-care products youâre selling. (newline) Job responsibilities: (newline) Here, you can list the basic day-to-day tasks you expect your software engineers to do. This might include writing code, attending weekly meetings, or preparing flowcharts. You get the idea. (newline) Work specifications: (newline) What do you expect from your potential hiree and what can your potential hiree expect from you? Offer reasonable compensation in the form of a salary, hourly wage, or commission. Include perks and benefits if thatâs part of the deal. Describe what capacity of work you want from your hire, whether itâs every weekday from 9-5 pm or as a freelancer on a single project. (newline) Qualifications: (newline) You will need to research a bit more about the exact skills you need from your hire. Maybe thatâs a bachelorâs degree in computer science or at least three years of (newline) writing JavaScript (newline) with a portfolio to match. Maybe itâs both. (newline) CTA: (newline) Lastly, use a call to action. Sum up anything else you need to say and end by drawing the candidate in. Whatâs so great about working with you and your business? Seriously. (newline) How Does Trio Hire Software Engineers (newline) Trio developers are specifically sought after based on their ability to communicate. While finding a developer who can list off several dozen technical skills is easy enough considering the hub of knowledge the average person has access to these days, often soft skills are what make all the difference. (newline) The core skills that every Trio developer has consist of communication, problem-solving, adaptability, empathy, and time management. These skills are essential for any collaborative project, and software development is by nature team-oriented. (newline) In looking for developers, Trio hiring managers also maintain that they are keen on finding someone with a âcultural fitâ who can âtalk about their passionsâ. This is evidence that the potential hiree truly cares about growing in their field. (newline) On the other hand, a developer who â[hasnât] experimented with a new technology in the past yearâ¦tells another story,â according to the co-founder of Trio, Alex Kugell. (newline) You could say that this is relevant to Trioâs mission and definitely worth mentioning in the job description. Developers who are just looking for a quick buck need not apply! (newline) Of course, getting to know the true intentions of a developer ties back into those communication skills that youâll get a glimpse of across the first couple of interviews. But an honest job description can weed out the worst apples. (newline) Conclusion (newline) Hopefully, seeing a bit of how Trio hires software engineers gives you some assurance that weâre taking our own advice. Weâve done our best to hire great software engineers so you can reap the benefits. (newline) Here at Trio, we value the talent of our engineers.

(newline) Software engineering is a branch of computer science that includes the development and building of computer systems software and applications software. Computer systems software is composed of programs that include computing utilities and operations systems. Applications software consists of user-focused programs that include web browsers, database programs, etc. (newline) Software engineers have extensive knowledge of programming languages, software development, and computer operating systems, and they apply engineering principles to software creation. (newline) By applying these engineering principles to every stage of the development process, from requirements analysis to the software process, they can create customized systems for individual clients. Just as a civil engineer will make sure that a bridge has a solid foundation, a software engineer will also begin with a thorough study of requirements and work through the development process in a systematic way. (newline) There are many types of software that a software engineer can develop, such as operating systems, computer games, middleware, business applications, and network control systems. Changes in technology and new areas of specialization keep this profession evolving at a rapid pace. (newline) When working with a client, a software engineer will typically analyze the client's needs, then design, test, and develop the computer software in order to meet those needs. They are experts in computing systems, software structure, and recognizing the limitations of the existing hardware. The process is complicated and intricate, therefore the use of diagrams, flowcharts, and the creation of (newline) algorithms to tell the computer what to do are created. Converting these instructions into a computer language (coding/programming) is usually the responsibility of a computer programmer. (newline) Software engineers must also possess interpersonal skills, and be able to effectively communicate with users in order to train, test, and debug software all the way to the end product. They are often involved from the early stages of software planning right through to the testing, development, training, and support stages. (newline) Software engineers can be divided into two categories: (newline) Applications Engineers (newline) Applications engineers create or adapt applications for businesses and organizations by analyzing the end user's needs. They will design, build, install, and maintain these applications or programs. (newline) Systems Engineers (newline) Systems engineers coordinate the creation, maintenance and growth of a business or organization's computer systems. They coordinate each department's needs, suggest technical direction, and set up any networks that link up computers with the company. (newline) Being a software engineer is a great career choice for someone who is exceptionally good at both left and right-brained thinking (analytical skills as well as problem-solving skills). Software engineers are instinctive problem-solvers, good at working with others and focused on seeing issues through to their successful completion. (newline) A software engineer should be well-versed in: (newline) Programming and coding (newline) Fundamentals of computer science (newline) Design and architecture (newline) Algorithms and data structures (newline) Information analysis (newline) Debugging software (newline) Testing software (newline) Are you suited to be a software engineer? (newline) Software engineers have distinct personalities. They tend to be investigative individuals, which means theyâre intellectual, introspective, and inquisitive. They are curious, methodical, rational, analytical, and logical. Some of them are also conventional, meaning theyâre conscientious and conservative. (newline) Does this sound like you?

(newline) With such unprecedented growth in a multitude of industries, software engineers can pursue careers in any number of areas, including technology, healthcare, automotive manufacturing, green energy, remote sensing, aeronautics, government, non-profit, and finance. (newline) Software engineers can work as either employees or as contractors. They typically work in comfortable settings, but it is sometimes a stressful job that involves long hours and tight deadlines. (newline) Frequently Asked Questions (newline) What career options are available for a software engineer? (newline) Technology is growing at a rapid pace, and opportunities in software development are growing right along with it. For software engineers with an appetite to develop valuable interpersonal skills, management roles are widely available. (newline) Interpersonal skills (or soft skills) include communication, conflict management, empathy, leadership, listening, negotiation, a positive attitude, and being able to work as part of a team. (newline) Individuals who are technically skilled communicators have many options available to them. They can, in time, qualify for a variety of roles, including Senior Engineer, Team Lead, Architect, Manager, and can eventually make their way to senior management. The pace of a career path progression depends on someone demonstrating technical ability, inner drive, analytical thinking and excellent communication skills. (newline) A software engineer's career path could look something like this: (newline) Junior Web Developer (newline) This is a starting or ground-floor position that an individual right out of college or an accelerated course could get with little to no computer programming experience. One can start applying for job postings as a junior web developer with a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Any number of online coding schools or in-person programs and dev bootcamps offer classes in these programming languages. (newline) Requirements for a junior web developer include: being able to write simple scripts; having an understanding of the expected application lifecycle; and possessing a basic understanding of database and application services, such as caching and queues. (newline) There may be occasions when junior web developers feel overwhelmed when they are asked to write complicated applications. Other days they may wonder why they are doing similar work to a senior web developer and not getting promoted. Both scenarios are completely normal. However, the biggest difference between a junior and senior developer is their level of experience. (newline) Software Web Developer, Sr. Software Web Developer (newline) A software web developer, or senior software web developer is someone who has: several years of professional programming experience; can write complex code; possesses a thorough understanding of databases, application services and application lifecycle development; and has become proficient at creating entire applications. Much of a software engineerâs career path will involve spending several years as a senior web developer. (newline) People who donât like the idea of management and prefer to stick with writing code can spend many years or even their entire career as a senior web developer. However, this position can also be a great jumping off point to a position as a software engineer or a manager, such as lead software engineer or CTO (chief technical officer) of a startup. (newline) Lead Software Engineer, Technical Architect (newline) For someone who wants to take on additional responsibility and more of a challenge, but is not interested in team management, a lead software engineer or architect role may be a great fit. (newline) Lead engineers are looked to for guidance and direction by other engineers and programmers, and the role is seen as a mid-level management position. Lead engineers still write code, but also collaborate with others regarding work flow priorities and implement final decisions. They have years of programming experience, expertise in a specific subject matter, and can think of, plan, and build appropriate software to solve complicated problems. (newline) Architects still write code occasionally as well, however they are mainly responsible for designing complex systems that other web developers will implement. The role of architect is a technical one and not usually a stepping stone to something more - often thought of as the highest position on the technical side of things. (newline) Development Team Lead, Software Development Manager (newline) Management is the next step along the software engineer's career path that can involve different focuses and responsibilities. These can include managing teams of developers, managing large-scale projects, and hiring and firing developers. (newline) Mid-level managers (like lead software engineers) keep track of productivity and workflow in the department and report to a senior manager. A senior manager coordinates the needs of the project leader with the development team, which requires excellent people skills and the ability to resolve conflict effectively. The senior managerâs job is also to add or terminate employees to the team whenever necessary which can be a challenge at first, but a powerful leadership skill when mastered. (newline) Director, Vice President, Chief Technology Officer (newline) Senior management (which can include titles such as director, vice president, or chief technology officer) report to the CEO or to the company's board of directors. They oversee the work of other managers and often have some responsibility towards setting strategic and corporate direction. Some executive type responsibilities may include setting goals and initiatives, developing long-term strategies, and holding various departments accountable for specific measurable objectives. Senior managers are also responsible for supervising, hiring, and firing mid-level managers. (newline) If managing people is just not something you are interested in, a career as a software engineer still provides such a decent level of income that you can still be a team contributor and have a rewarding career. (newline) Continue reading (newline) What is the difference between a software engineer and a software developer? (newline) One of the main differences between software engineering and software development is job function. Software engineering applies engineering principles to create software, therefore software engineers take part in software development by connecting the clientâs needs with technological solutions. They systematically develop processes to provide specific functions by using engineering concepts to develop software. (newline) On the other hand, software developers are responsible for the entire development process and are the driving creative force behind programs. They typically work together with the client to create a conceptual design and then have computer programmers create the programming code needed to run the software. (newline) The computer programmers along with the software developers will test and fix problems together and the developers will provide project leadership and technical guidance through each stage of the software development life cycle. (newline) To sum things up, a software engineer is often involved with software development, but very few software developers are engineers. The main difference between software engineering and software development is that one oversees the engineering while the other focuses on creating functional programs. (newline) Continue reading (newline) See Also (newline) Web Developer (newline) What does it take to succeed as a software engineer? (newline) Attracted by high salaries, strong employment opportunities, and a chance to build things that can change the world, more people than ever are choosing software engineering as a career choice. However, succeeding in this career requires more than just great coding ability. The best software engineers bring specific qualities and attributes to the job that make them stand out from everyone else. (newline) Working well with others (newline) There are many media portrayals of a lone-wolf that stays up all night coding furiously in isolation. This stereotype represents coders as exceptionally smart but emotionally stunted. Unfortunately this type of temperament doesn't work well in real life. Software engineers who know how to work well with others are much more likely to be successful in their careers than lone wolves are. (newline) A software engineer's job is to figure problems out and to produce a great product, not just to write as many amazing lines of code as possible. That means communicating with other engineers, developers, managers, quality control people, customers, etc. and treating them with respect and understanding. The better your relationships are with your team, the better your own work will be. (newline) Letting go of the ego (newline) Not bringing your ego to work with you and staying humble can be difficult at times. No matter how good you think you are at what you do, it's inevitable that you will make mistakes along with some bad decisions. Accepting constructive criticism from your peers when errors are pointed out and accepting responsibility for your mistakes will make you a much better engineer in the long run. Possessing a humble attitude is the only way you'll be able to channel other people's feedback into improving, learning, and making yourself a better software engineer and person. (newline) Not putting out mediocre work (newline) Software engineers who pay attention to details tend to write higher-quality code. They tend to step back and catch mistakes, instead of rushing and cutting corners. Those that feel a personal sense of ownership and pride when it comes to their work tend to be more successful in this career. Putting effort into what you're doing wards off mediocrity and gives you that push to produce high-quality work and not get too complacent. Also, sharpening your skills by learning new languages or keeping abreast of any new data structures or algorithms can keep things interesting and fresh. (newline) Being naturally curious and interested (newline) People who love to learn are constantly improving and exploring new and better ways to do things. By listening to podcasts, reading blogs, or going to conferences, you can stay on top of the latest trends in software engineering and be looped into topics that will make you a stronger and more well-rounded engineer. By being open to new things, new ideas and approaches to solving problems may come to you that wouldn't have occurred to you otherwise. (newline) Developing soft skills (newline) Soft skills are fast becoming hard skills in this ever-changing world. Itâs simply not enough to be highly skilled as a software engineer without developing skills that help you get along with your team effectively. These skills have a significant impact on a your attitude which ultimately ties back to your success. The skills for success tend to be fairly consistent - adaptability, problem-solving, self-management, attention to detail, creativity, communication, collaboration, work ethic, empathy, and organization are just a few. Keeping these qualities in mind can help any engineer improve, no matter how experienced. (newline) Seeing the big picture (newline) Understanding and balancing the day-to-day steps that are required to get to a goal yet not losing sight of the long-term vision is key to being a successful software engineer. By practicing this skill and thinking ahead, you will be able to see how each individual component will eventually contribute to the product as a whole and how each element will interact with each other. The ability to weigh out the long- and short-term outlook and see how certain decisions can influence the scope and direction of a project is a key attribute. Being able to adapt and prevent a project from derailing is what separates really good engineers from mediocre ones. (newline) Continue reading (newline) How long does it take to become a Software Engineer? (newline) The software industry is always changing. (newline) This means that a career as a software engineer demands a commitment to learning that starts in high school, is solidified in university, and continues with career-long professional certifications and training. (newline) A four- or five- year Bachelorâs Degree in Computer Software Engineering is the typical education track required for entry into the software engineering profession. (newline) What are Software Engineers like? (newline) Based on our pool of users, software engineers tend to be predominately investigative people. (newline) This finding is reflective of all of the work that these engineers do. (newline) Whether they are learning technologies, writing software, or debugging issues, the capacity to investigate â to carry out a systematic inquiry to discover the facts â is fundamental. (newline) Should I become a Software Engineer? (newline) There is a lot of investment going into software engineering at the moment due to the increasing reliance on mobile technology, venture capital-backed start-ups, the growing complexity of technology, and emerging industries. (newline) The demand for skilled and qualified software engineers seems to have no end. This demand is strengthened by a changing economic landscape and fueled by the need for technology solutions. With billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet and that are collecting and sharing data, all industries are quickly becoming technology driven industries. (newline) âBuilding software solutions that power virtually every organization, itâs a cool job.â (newline) That is often the comment heard about working as a software engineer. (newline) And while it is true, it is also a demanding job, one that typically requires employees to work long hours to often short deadlines in an environment where a single mistake can result in a massive bug. (newline) So, what type of a person does it take to be an effective software engineer? (newline) Here are some qualities that are essential in the role: (newline) A dedication to learning (newline) There are some jobs that you have to learn once and never again. (newline) Software engineering is the exact opposite to this. (newline) More than in almost any other function, software engineers need to continually be learning. (newline) There are always new software languages to master and new technologies and techniques to learn. (newline) If you are not committed to learning, your skills will quickly become antiquated. (newline) A passion for improving whatâs around you (newline) The best software engineers are constantly thinking about how to improve the world around them. (newline) They are always tinkering, listening to user feedback, and following their intuition to produce and continually improve software solutions. (newline) A logical, analytical mindset (newline) Writing code is much like writing in general. (newline) Itâs about using the fewest number of characters possible to make your point. (newline) Itâs about taking a complex set of instructions and boiling it down to its most integral parts. (newline) Itâs about making decisions based on data and research. (newline) If you have a penchant for logic games and puzzles, software engineering may be a career fit for you. (newline) A sharp attention to detail (newline) Mistakes while coding lead to bugs, which lead to customer frustration and complaints and lost revenues. (newline) An eye for detail and a willingness to thoroughly â almost feverishly â test and revise your work are key qualities of successful software engineers. (newline) Perseverance (newline) When developing a piece of software, there is no magic formula that dictates how the solution will be achieved. (newline) Software engineers need a certain doggedness to find the right path to building a specific application or system. (newline) The ability to work with others (newline) In field of software engineering, this is an underrated but critically important skill. (newline) Yes, coding itself is often solitary work. (newline) But it is almost always done in the framework of a larger team. (newline) Collaboration, therefore, is indispensable, to leverage and maximize the abilities, talents, and input of everyone to devise solutions.

After all, what could be âharderâ than ones and zeroes? In reality, though, the rigorous examination of cause and effect that characterizes science has been much less common in this field than in supposedly soft disciplines like marketing, which long ago traded in the gut-based gambles of âMad Menâ for quantitative, analytic approaches. (newline) A growing number of researchers believe software engineering is now at a turning point comparable to the dawn of evidence-based medicine, when the health-care community began examining its practices and sorting out which interventions actually worked and which were just-so stories. This burgeoning field is known as empirical software engineering and as interest in it has exploded over the past decade, it has begun to borrow and adapt research techniques from fields as diverse as anthropology, psychology, industrial engineering and data mining. (newline) Figure 1. Making software is a signature activity of our era that has produced a canon of beliefs and practices, yet only recently have the tools of social science and empirical investigation been systematically applied on a large scale to the software enterprise. Empirical software engineering is the emerging discipline of acquiring a rigorous, evidence-based understanding of what we know about making software, what we donât know and what we can learn about it using the tools of empirical research. (newline) Illustration by Tom Dunne. (newline) Ad Right (newline) The stakes couldnât be higher. The software industry employs tens of millions of people worldwide; even small increases in their productivity could be worth billions of dollars a year. And with software landing our planes, diagnosing our illnesses and keeping track of the wealth of nations, discovering how to make programs more reliable is hardly an academic question. Where We Are Broadly speaking, people who study programming empirically come at the problem from one of two angles. To some, the phrase software engineering has always had a false ring. In practice, very few programmers analyze software mathematically the way that ârealâ engineers analyze the strength of bridges or the resonant frequency of an electrical circuit. Instead, programming is a skilled craft, more akin to architecture, which makes the human element an important (some would say the important) focus of study. Hollywood may think that programmers are all solitary 20-something males hacking in their parentsâ basement in the wee hours of the morning, but most real programmers work in groups subject to distinctly human patterns of behavior and interaction. Those patterns can and should be examined using the empirical, often qualitative tools developed by the social and psychological sciences. (newline) The other camp typically focuses on the âwhatâ rather than the âwho.â Along with programs themselves, programmers produce a wealth of other digital artifacts: bug reports, email messages, design sketches and so on. Employing the same kinds of data-mining techniques that Amazon uses to recommend books and that astronomers use to find clusters of galaxies, software engineering researchers inspect these artifacts for patterns. Does the number of changes made to a program correlate with the number of bugs found in it? Does having more people work on a program make it better (because more people have a chance to spot problems) or worse (because of communication stumbles)? One sign of how quickly these approaches are maturing is the number of data repositories that have sprung up, including the University of Nebraskaâs Software Artifact Infrastructure Repository, the archives of NASAâs highly influential Software Engineering Laboratory and the National Science Foundationâfunded CeBASE, which organizes project data and lessons learned. All are designed to facilitate data sharing, amplifying the power of individual researchers. (newline) The questions we and our colleagues seek to answer are as wide-ranging as those an anthropologist might ask during first contact with a previously unknown culture. How do people learn to program? Can the future success of a programmer be predicted by personality tests? Does the choice of programming language affect productivity? Can the quality of code be measured? Can data mining predict the location of software bugs? Is it more effective to design code in detail up front or to evolve a design week by week in response to the accretion of earlier code? Convincing data about all of these questions are now in hand, and we are learning how to tackle many others. (newline) Along the way, our field is grappling with the fundamental issues that define any new science. How do we determine the validity of data? When can conclusions from one contextâone programming team, or one vast project, like the development of the Windows Vista operating systemâbe applied elsewhere? And crucially, which techniques are most appropriate for answering different kinds of questions? (newline) Some of the most exciting discoveries are described in a recent book called Making Software: What Really Works, and Why We Believe It, edited by Andy Oram and Greg Wilson (OâReilly Media, 2011), in which more than 40 researchers present the key results of their work and the work of others. Weâll visit some of that research to give an overview of progress in this field and to demonstrate the ways in which it is unique terrain for empirical investigation. Quality by the Numbers A good example of the harvest that empirical studies are generating relates to one of the holy grails of software engineering: the ability to measure the quality of a program, not by running it and looking for errors, but by automated examination of the source code itself. Any technique that could read a program and predict how reliable it would be before it is delivered to customers would save vast sums of money, and probably lives as well. (newline) Figure 2. There are many reasons to measure the complexity of computer code. The simplest metric of complexity for the snippet of code in (a ) above, written in the C language, is the number of lines. Next simplest is often the number of C functions; in the sample code here, one. At a higher level, McCabeâs cyclomatic complexity allows us to calculate the number of independent paths in the code and render them in a control-flow graph (b ). Halsteadâs software science metric analyzes complexity based on number and redundant use of textual elements, without reference to program structure. Herraiz and Hassan tested whether any of the higher measures provided more diagnostic information about complexity than the simplest measure, lines of code. (Figure adapted from material in Herraiz, I., and A. E. Hassan. 2011. Beyond lines of code: Do we need more complexity metrics? In Making Software: What Really Works and Why We Believe It. Sebastopol, CA: OâReilly Media, 125â144.) (newline) Illustration by Tom Dunne. (newline) One consistent discovery is that, in general, the more lines of code there are in a program, the more defects it probably has. This result may seem obvious, even trivial, but it is a starting point for pursuing deeper questions of code quality. Not all lines of code are equal: One line might add 2 + 2 while another integrates a polynomial in several variables and a third checks to see whether several conditions are true before ringing an alarm. Intuitively, programmers believe that some kinds of code are more complex than others, and that the more complex a piece of code is, the more likely it is to be buggy. Can we devise some way to measure this complexity? And if so, can the location of complexity hot spots predict where defects will be found? (newline) One of the first attempts to answer this question was developed by Thomas J. McCabe and is known as cyclomatic complexity. McCabe realized that any program can be represented as a graph whose arcs show the possible execution paths through the code. The simplest graph is a straight chain, which represents a series of statements with no conditions or loops. Each if statement creates a parallel path through the graph; two such statements create four possible paths. Figure 2 shows a snippet of code extracted from a cross-platform download manager called Uget. The graph in part (b) shows the paths through the code; each if and loop adds one unit of complexity, giving this code an overall complexity score of 3. (newline) Another widely used complexity measure is Maurice Halsteadâs software science metric, which he first described in 1977. Instead of graph theory, it draws on information theory and is based on four easily measured features of code that depend on the number of distinct operators and operands, their total count, how easy they are to discriminate from one another and so on. Figure 2(c) shows the values for the sample piece of code in (a). (newline) Hundreds of other metrics have been developed, published and analyzed over the past 30 years. In their chapter, Herraiz and Hassan use statistical techniques to explore a simple question: Are any of these metrics actually better at predicting errors than simply counting the number lines of source code? Put another way, if a complexity metric is highly correlated with the number of lines of source code, does it actually provide any information that the simpler measure does not? (newline) For a case study, Herraiz and Hassan chose to examine the open-source Arch Linux operating system distribution, which yielded a sample of 338,831 unique source files in the C language. They calculated the measures discussed above, and several others, for each of these files, taking special account of header files (those consisting mainly of declarations that assist in code organization). They found that for nonheader files, where programs actually do their work, all the metrics tested showed a very high degree of correlation with lines of code. Checking for generalizability, the effect held for all but very small files. The authors drew a clear lesson: âSyntactic complexity metrics cannot capture the whole picture of software complexity.â Whether based on program structure or textual properties, the metrics do not provide more information than simply âweighingâ the code by counting the number of lines. (newline) Like all negative results, this one is a bit disappointing. However, that does not mean these metrics are uselessâfor example, McCabeâs scheme tells testers how many different execution paths their tests need to cover. Above all, the value here is in the progress of the science itself. The next time someone puts forward a new idea for measuring complexity, a validated, empirical test of its effectiveness will be there waiting for them. (newline) Two-Headed Approach Metrics research looks at the code that programmers produce, but at least as much research effort has focused on how they produce it. An interesting case is pair programming, a work style that burst onto the scene in the late 1990s (though people have been using it informally for as long as programming has existed). In pair programming, two programmers sit at a single workstation and create code together. The driver handles the keyboard and mouse, while the navigator watches, comments and offers corrections. Many programmers have noticed over the years that duos like this seem to produce code more quickly and with fewer bugs. If asked, they would probably say that the benefits arise because different people naturally notice different sorts of things, or because not having to type gives the navigator more time to think, or possibly that having an audience makes the driver think more carefully. But is pair programming actually better, and if so, which of the possible explanations is the reason? (newline) Figure 3. To the uninitiated, pair programming seems an out-there technique. Two programmers work at the same machine, usually with one piloting the keyboard, the other flying in the rear seat of the cockpit. Many innovators in software practices laud pair programming. Whether it should be preferred can be and has been investigated rigorously via a wide range of experiments that test different personality matches, different protocols for determining to whom control of the keyboard is assigned and different types of problems. (newline) Illustration by Tom Dunne. (newline) The first empirical study of pair programming, by Temple University professor John Nosek in 1998, studied 15 programmers, 5 working alone (the control group), the other 10 in 5 pairs. A challenging programming problem was given, with a time limit of 45 minutes. The results were statistically significant. Solutions produced by the pairs took 60 percent more total time, but dividing the total time by two, they completed the tasks 20 percent faster. And the author of the study reported that the pairs produced higher-quality code. (newline) Subsequent studies with larger groups over longer periods of time, summarized by Laurie Williams at North Carolina State University, have expanded on these early results. Pair programmers tend to produce code that is easier to understand, and they do so with higher morale. Their productivity may fall initially as the programmers adjust to the new work style, but productivity recovers and often surpasses its initial level as programmer teams acquire experience. Related studies have also given insight into what actually happens during pair programming. For example, successful pairs often donât work together for a full dayâpairing can be mentally exhausting. Changing partners regularly seems to help, and swapping roles periodically between driver and navigator helps keep programmers engaged. (newline) These results can even influence hardware design. Some teams have two people who both do best when they have control of the keyboard. Why not provide dual keyboards and mice? Jan Chong and Tom Hurlbutt tested this approach at Stanford University in 2007 and found it a worthwhile advance in pair programming, a finding subsequently supported by additional studies by Andreas HÃ¶fer at the University of Karlsruhe and by Sallyann Freudenberg, a software coach. Once again, what weâre seeing is the science rapidly improving as early studies generate questions and methods for follow-on research. (newline) What we also see is that being right isnât always enough to effect change. Despite the accumulation of evidence in its favor, pair programming is still very much the exception in industry. Managers and programmers alike often brush the data away, clinging to the idea that putting two people on one job must double staffing requirements and therefore cannot deliver efficiency. This is an unfortunate phenomenon in many fields. Some people resist change tenaciously, even in the face of evidence and at the risk of failure. (newline) Getting Good Programmers Another holy grail of empirical software engineering research is finding a way to tell good programmers from bad. A widely quoted piece of folklore says that good programmers are 28 times better than average (or 40, or 100, or some other large number). As teacher and developer Steve McConnell discusses in Making Software, the precise quantification of this assertion may be suspect, given that the definition of âbetterâ is elusive in any knowledge-based work. Yet everyone who has programmed for a living knows that there really are huge differences in productivity and capability among programmers. Other than hiring someone and watching her work for a couple of years, how can we spot the stars? (newline) Figure 4. Measuring programmer aptitude and skill is the difficult art of devising a number line from âzeroâ to âgreat.â (newline) Illustration by Tom Dunne. (newline) Jo Erskine Hannay at Simula Research Laboratory has addressed the issues of talent and expertise by breaking the question into parts: Can we actually define what it means to be a good software developer? Can we reliably determine that one developer is better than another? And if we canât, should we surrender on those questions and focus instead on tools and techniques? (newline) Hannay zeroes in on a field called individual differences research, in which individuals are classified by characteristics that separate one from another, such as personality. Although some pseudoscientific schemes used by human resources departments and dating websites have given personality testing a bad reputation, modern programs such as the five-factor model have solid scientific foundations (or as scientists might put it, we have construct validity for the concept of measuring personality). The five-factor model and similar protocols address dimensions that include extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and willingness and ability to learn from experience. We also know that programmers tend to have certain personality types and that they vary less in personality than the average population. Can we use findings like these to discover good programmers? (newline) The short answer is no. Large meta-analyses and further studies by Hannay and others conclude that a programmerâs personality is not a strong predictor of performance. The people who swear by their beliefs about personality and programmer success have now been given reason to assess their position critically, along with methodological support for doing so. Credible Accreditation If we canât predict who will become a good programmer, can we at least certify who already is one? Would it help if software developers were required to undergo some sort of certification? In most of the industrialized world, engineering professionals must be licensed; a preliminary exam permits them to practice and gain experience as an engineer-in-training, followed some years later by a deeper exam, often specialized according to their discipline. Successful candidates are then allowed to offer their services to the public. Could such a program be developed for software engineers? And would it actually make anything better? (newline) Figure 5. Two goals of software research are the ability to compare programmers and determine which is âbetter,â and the ability to algorithmically analyze code to determine its quality. The basic goal of both is better software. One route to better software could be credentialing and licensure of software engineers like that imposed on civil and other engineers. Mastery of a body of knowledge would be the gateway, but at present that would be establishing a required body of knowledge before demonstrating empirically that it is the right body of knowledge. (newline) Illustration by Tom Dunne. (newline) If done right, such a program would be based on a codified body of necessary knowledge and best practices, just as exams in civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering are. A major effort under way right now is the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge project (SWEBOK), sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. Their intentions are noble, and conscientious professionals are steadily assembling a potential set of standards. (newline) We are skeptical of this work, for the very reasons that we are committed to empirical software engineering research. We believe that it puts the cart before the horse, that we simply donât yet know enough about what actually works and what doesnât to define such standards. In place of a trustworthy gateway, we fear that a Software Engineering Body of Strong Opinion would create a false belief that we know more than we do at present about how software can and should be made, how the quality of software can be rigorously determined and how programmers should take on the job of programming. That knowledge is the very thing empirical software researchers are stalking. (newline) For example, in the 1990s a group of respected software designers combined forces to create a graphical notation for computer programs called the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which was intended to fill the role of blueprints and circuit diagrams in civil and electrical engineering. Despite a great deal of hype, UML never really caught on: Almost everyone who earns a degree in computer science learns about UML at some point, but very few programmers use it voluntarily (although some are obliged to use it in order to satisfy the terms of government procurement contracts). (newline) In 2007, Mario Cherubini, Gina Venolia, Rob DeLine and Andrew Ko studied what kinds of diagrams programmers actually draw and why they draw them. They found that in almost all cases, programmersâ sketches were transient in nature; they were meant to be aids to conversation rather than archival documentation. They also found that the cost of turning hastily drawn whiteboard doodles into formal instructions was greater than the value of the diagrams to the programmers who were creating them. Companies selling UML drawing tools ignore this awkward result, but we are hopeful that a younger generation of software designers will incorporate into their work both findings like these and the research methods behind them. Life Imitates Code In 1967, only partly as a wry joke, Melvin Conway coined his eponymous law: (newline) Any organization that designs a system â¦ will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organizationâs communications structure. (newline) In other words, if the people writing a program are divided into four teams, the program they create will have four major parts. (newline) Nachi Nagappan, Christian Bird and others at Microsoft Research evaluated the validity of Conwayâs law by examining data collected during the construction of Windows Vista. Vista consists of thousands of interrelated libraries and programs called binaries. When an error occurs, the breakdown can usually be traced to a fault in a single binary or to a breakdown in the interaction between binaries. Nagappan, Bird, and their team used data mining to explore which aspects of software construction correlated with faults. They found that when work occurred in alignment with Conwayâs lawâthat is, when the structure of the team and the structure of the code mirrored each otherâcode contained fewer bugs, whereas work that crossed team boundaries increased failure-proneness. (newline) Nagappan and his collaborators then used their data to predict failure-? proneness by locating code produced by multiple groups or at the interface of multiple groups. Contrary to digital folklore, they found that geographic separation between team members didnât have a strong impact on the quality of their work. What did matter was organizational separation: The farther apart team members were in the company organization chart, the greater the number of faults in the software they produced. This result is applied science at its best: It is both surprising and actionable. (newline) Open Access At present, a tremendous enabler of empirical software engineering research is the open-source software movement, which is rapidly generating a freely available accumulation of code along with complete archives of the communications between developers. In an open-source setting, programmers collect around software projects to produce applications that they want to see available for free. The developers are often in different places and time zones, so communication occurs via email and online forums. The code and communication records are accessible to all via websites, so interested developers can join the project at any stage to share expertise, troubleshoot and add to the source code. (newline) Figure 6. Like the rest of social science research, empirical software engineering faces challenges in establishing that results are generalizable. Do findings scale from small shops to large, from small projects to large, from industrial, tightly managed settings to the milieu dubbed the open-source bazaar by Eric Raymond? (newline) Illustration by Tom Dunne. (newline) These electronic repositories are a software-engineering researcherâs paradise. They constitute a historical record of the life of a project, including all of the dead ends and debates, the task assignments, the development of team structure and many other artifacts. With thoughtful and targeted searches, researchers can explore topics such as how newcomers adapt to a software projectâs culture. They can test prediction engines to assess the validity of theories about project structure and code development. Bug-tracking records and the interpersonal interactions involved in solving software flaws serve as a narrative of the incremental improvement of code quality. Before the open-source community took on its present form, this kind of access to project archives was available only to investigators in corporate research units. (newline) As the open-source movement developed, there was a feeling that researchers should treat it as a special case in the realm of software engineering. Eric Raymond, president of the Open Source Initiative, highlighted the differences between open-source and industrial projects when he compared them to a bazaar and a cathedral. Industry is the cathedral, in which projects are built according to carefully detailed plans, with attendant hierarchy, role divisions, order and dogma. The bazaar is bustling, free-form, organic and shaped by the aggregate actions of the crowd. Researchers bringing results from the open-source world met skepticism about whether their findings could be generalized to the rest of the community. In fact, research has demonstrated that the distinctions between the two worlds are often illusory. There are cathedrals in the open-source sphere and bazaars in the closed-source. Similar social and technical trends can be documented in both, and researchers have come to appreciate the dividends that come from comparing the two. (newline) The work of Guido Schryen at the University of Freiberg and Eliot Rich at the University at Albany, SUNY, is instructive about how to ask and answer questions about the two worlds. In a 2010 paper they addressed a much-debated and critically important issue: Which model leads to better security, open- or closed-source software? Security is a formidable concern for any software that will come within reach of networks. Schryen and Rich examined the security-vulnerability announcements and the release (or nonrelease) of patches (software fixes) for 17 widely deployed software packages. Proponents of open-source software have argued that its characteristically wide developer base must lead to better review and response to security issues. An opposing argument holds that closed-source and industrial projects have more direct motivation to find and fix security flaws. Schryen and Rich sorted the packages they studied within categories such as open- and closed-source, application type (operating system, web server, web browser and so on), and structured or loose organization. They found that security vulnerabilities were equally severe for both open- and closed-source systems, and they further found that patching behavior did not align with an openâversus-closed source divide. In fact, they were able to show that application type is a much better determinant of vulnerability and response to security issues, and that patching behavior is directed by organizational policy without any correlation to the organizational structure that produced the software. Whether open- or closed-source software was more secure turned out to be the wrong question to ask. We do not expect that the lines between the open- and closed-source worlds will be so blurred in every aspect of software engineering, but results like these show how the massive amount of information available as a byproduct of open-source development can be put to scientific use. (newline) As in any applied science, the ultimate measure of success for all of this work will be changeâchange in the tools used to develop software, change from current practices to those that are provably better and most importantly, change in what is and is not accepted as proof.

(newline) Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of the C++ programming language, once said that "our civilization runs on software." This statement is impressively backed by reality, in which software controls a huge variety of devices, from cell phones and music players, to smart appliances such as microwave ovens and laundry machines, to personal computers that many people use at work and large mainframe computers that operate in governmental organizations. In fact, it is hard to imagine an area of human activity that does not rely at least partially on software, including professional work, home activities, and entertainment. (newline) Using a basic definition, software means computer programs and their associated documentation. Computer programs, in turn, consist of algorithms (or procedures) applied to various types of data. Software engineering emerged in the late 1960s as a new engineering discipline concerned with all aspects pertaining to software production. It encompasses concepts, principles, theories, techniques and tools that can be used for developing high-quality professional software. First introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany, software engineering emphasizes a systematic, disciplined approach to software development and evolution and typically applies to the construction of large software systems (or products) in which teams of numerous software engineers are involved. (newline) High-quality software is characterized by: (newline) High dependability (including safety, security and reliability) (newline) Efficiency (newline) Usability (newline) Accessibility (newline) Maintainability (newline) A software product is said to have a life-cycle, or undergo a software process, which in software engineering terms consists essentially of two parts: development and evolution. Both involve traditional engineering phases, software development consisting primarily of concept creation, requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, testing, and deployment. On the other hand, software evolution involves operation and maintenance as well as some limited development activities aimed at improving the software. (newline) Applications of software engineering (newline) Software engineering applications are practically unlimited. In fact, software engineering has grown so fast in the last several decades that it has become tightly connected with all other areas of computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence, parallel processing, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, database management systems, and many others) as well as with some areas outside the traditional computer domain (such as cognitive sciences and visual arts). (newline) Challenges in software engineering (newline) Current challenges in software engineering research and development include: (newline) Dealing with the increased complexity of software required in new applications (newline) The diversity of software systems that need to communicate/operate with each other (newline) The need to develop trustworthy software (newline) Increased market demands for a quick turnaround from concept to deployment and operation (newline) The quest for increased efficiency in component-based reuse and automatic code generation (newline) Studying software engineering (newline) Students who want to focus on software engineering are expected to gain and integrate knowledge from various subject areas including computer programming, data structures, algorithms, numerical methods, statistics, design patterns, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, information visualization, database systems, web development, software project management, and software engineering. (newline) Internship and employment opportunities in software engineering (newline) Software engineers are in high demand nationally and abroad. The list of companies hiring software engineers is practically endless. While most jobs are in industry, research labs also hire skilled software engineers, either for research in software engineering itself or for supporting software development in research environments. Furthermore, skilled software engineers are also hired by start-up companies, or are well prepared to start their own software development companies. (newline) Notably, under the umbrella of software engineering several specialized professions exist besides software engineer itself, including computer programmer, analyst, designer, developer, tester, consultant and others.

Try Career Planner (newline) Software engineers apply scientific and mathematical principles in order to create computer software and solve problems (newline) As a software engineer, you'll work in a constantly evolving environment, due to technological advances and the strategic direction of the organisation you work for. You'll create, maintain, audit and improve systems to meet particular needs, often as advised by a systems analyst or architect, testing both hard and software systems to diagnose and resolve system faults. (newline) The role also covers writing diagnostic programs and designing and writing code for operating systems and software to ensure efficiency. When required, you'll make recommendations for future developments. (newline) Job titles and descriptions in IT are not standardised. Instead of a software engineer, you may be called a systems/software/database/web programmer, engineer or developer, depending on the system you're developing. Alternatively, the programming language you use may become part of your title, such as Java or C# developer. The work of a software engineer can also form part of a multimedia programmer role. (newline) Depending on the organisation you work for, you may have a more defined role and work within a group of IT specialists which can include systems analysts, systems designers and systems testers. Nevertheless, as software engineers often manage the support systems required to effectively run an organisation, the role can also require you to communicate effectively and translate the needs of different teams into systems developments. Responsibilities As a software engineer, you'll need to: analyse user requirementswrite and test code, refining and rewriting it as necessary and communicate with any programmers involved in the projectresearch, design and write new software programs (e.g. business applications or computer games) and computer operating systemsevaluate the software and systems that make computers and hardware workdevelop existing programs by analysing and identifying areas for modificationintegrate existing software products and get incompatible platforms to work togethercreate technical specificationswrite systems to control the scheduling of jobs or to control the access allowed to users or remote systemswrite operational documentation with technical authorsmaintain systems by monitoring and correcting software defectswork closely with other staff, such as project managers, graphic artists, UX designers, other developers, systems analysts and sales and marketing professionalsconsult clients and colleagues concerning the maintenance and performance of software systems, with a view to writing or modifying current operating systemsinvestigate new technologiescontinually update technical knowledge and skills by attending in-house and external courses, reading manuals and accessing new applications.SalaryTypical graduate software engineer salaries start from Â£18,000 a year.The average annual salary for a software engineer is between Â£25,000 and Â£50,000.At senior or management level, software engineers can earn Â£45,000 to Â£70,000 or more per annum. Bonus schemes may be available. The exact salary you'll receive is dependent upon the company, location and nature of your employer's business. The highest salaries can be found in the finance, pensions and telecoms sectors in London and the South East. (newline) Income figures are intended as a guide only. Working hours Working hours are typically 9am to 5pm. However, longer hours are often necessary towards the end of projects as deadlines approach, as well as during the testing stage so that systems can be tested when they're not being used. In some cases, software engineers may be required to be on call to deal with problems. This can involve evening and weekend work in a shift pattern. Allowances may be available in these cases. (newline) Self-employment and freelance or contract work is possible as there is an increasing market for contract software engineers with specialist knowledge. Career breaks, on the other hand, may be difficult due to the need to keep technical knowledge up to date in a rapidly changing environment. Related case studies (newline) Vivian Knight (newline) Tech+ analyst (newline) Geraldine Abbey (newline) Software engineer (newline) Kiera Bowdidge (newline) Apprentice software engineer (newline) What to expectThe job involves spending many hours at the keyboard, so high levels of concentration are required. Regular breaks are essential to minimise potential adverse health effects such as eye strain or back problems.The work is mainly office based or in computer laboratories, although full or part-time remote working is becoming increasingly common.Projects may be undertaken alone or in small teams.Women are currently underrepresented in this profession and gender imbalance across the IT industry as a whole is a recognised issue. Steps are being taken to redress the balance. Women who want to work in technology should visit (newline) Women in Technology (newline) for information and jobs.Depending on the nature of the business, travel within a working day or absence from home at night may be required. This is more likely with consultancy work. More travel is involved in installation and implementation work.Want a career in the IT industry? Software Engineering (Conversion) MSc (newline) Visit Qualifications Although this area of work is open to all graduates, applicants will be expected to have some technical ability. Having studied one of the following subjects may increase your chances of employment: computer sciencecomputer software or computer systems engineeringelectronicsinformation systemsmathematicsphysics. Many of the larger graduate recruiters will only employ graduates with proven technical skills and a good degree (2:1 or above) in a computing-related discipline. (newline) Smaller companies generally prefer degrees of a computing, scientific or numeric nature. In some cases, however, graduates with an unrelated degree may be considered if their technical knowledge and enthusiasm can be demonstrated. (newline) Graduates in non-computer-related subjects may consider taking a postgraduate IT conversion or technical postgraduate course. Many employers will also look for evidence of continuing professional development (CPD) outside of the classroom. Project programming experience can be used as evidence during the application process to show that a candidate is technically adept and also has effective problem-solving skills. (newline) An HND in a computer-related subject may improve chances of entry and candidates with substantial systems development experience may be considered. (newline) Entry without a degree or HND is unlikely, although it may be possible after gaining considerable experience in systems development as an assistant. Skills You'll need to show evidence of the following: knowledge of computer systems and technologiestechnical competencythe ability to communicate with clients, colleagues and management to explain complex issues clearly and conciselya meticulous and organised approach to worka logical, analytical and creative approach to problemsthoroughness and attention to detailbusiness skills and commercial awarenessthe ability to work both in a team and alone and to manage your own workloadcareer motivation and a willingness to continue to further your knowledge and skillsan ability to learn new skills and technologies quicklyan awareness of current issues affecting the industry and its technologies.Work experience Relevant work experience is a good way of demonstrating a genuine interest in computing and is regarded favourably by employers.

Software engineers will often take ownership of their training needs, particularly in smaller organisations where they may not be managed by someone with technical IT knowledge. (newline) Large graduate employers often offer a structured programme, where you'll gain experience in a number of team-related projects in different work areas. Most companies offer ongoing training, either in-house or via external courses. (newline) If you're a freelance contractor or employed by a smaller company, you may need to consider the cost and time implications of taking responsibility for your own training. (newline) You can complete courses to obtain a variety of software-specific certifications, likeÂ Microsoft Learning, CertifiedÂ Scrum Master (CSM) and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). These courses can be expensive but are recognised throughout the industry and can enhance your career prospects when combined with experience. (newline) Other professional qualifications are available through BCS (The Chartered Institute for IT). BCS Professional Certificates come in foundation, intermediate, practitioner and higher levels. BCS can also help by providing information and guidance to members on recognising and planning learning needs and developing areas of expertise. (newline) Up-to-date information on training and relevant industry-recognised qualifications is also provided by the Institution of Analysts and Programmers (IAP). (newline) To further your career progression, you may consider training in areas such as business, management and finance. Career prospects There are different levels of software engineering and promotion is usually dependent upon both ability and experience. (newline) An entry-level post typically involves working under supervision, formulating the scope of, and objectives, for systems and designing code. After around three years, you may progress to preparing detailed specifications from which programs may be written and be competent to work at the highest technical level. (newline) A senior software engineer often supervises the activities of a team of developers for a large project or several smaller projects. This usually requires a minimum of five years' experience. (newline) Progression is mainly into management via team leadership and project management roles, or to designer/consultant via technical specialisation. Transfer between organisations for advancement is often possible. (newline) Software engineers are specialists and may remain within one organisation, and frequently in one role, for much of their working lives. However, others expand and develop their roles to the extent that software engineering becomes part of a much wider role in positions such as technical writing, IT training and education. They can also move on to the role of software architect. (newline) Both BCS and IAP provide up-to-date information and advice on career development.

(newline) Software Developer vs. Software Engineer: Whatâs the Difference? (newline) If youâre confused about the difference between software developers and software engineers, youâre not alone. Not only is there an overlap in some of the skills required for both developers and engineers, but experts in the field disagree on whether or not the titles even matter. Whatâs important to know is that software developers and software engineers arenât the same thing, and as long as employers keep searching for developers and engineers, itâs worth knowing the difference. (newline) Skills (newline) Okay, letâs explore the different skill-sets involved with becoming a software developer or software engineer. For instance, if you like working with people and finding creative solutions, you might want to consider becoming a software developer. On the other hand, if you feel more comfortable working with a wide range of engineering principles, software engineering might be better. (newline) Thatâs because the main difference between being a software developer vs software engineer is mainly in the job function itself. Software engineers may take a hand in development, but developers seldom get too involved in the engineering side of things. Of course, thereâs more to it than just this, but this distinction is probably the easiest way to differentiate the two positions. (newline) More specifically, developers work directly with the client to figure out what they want, then lead a team to implement the design while keeping in contact with their clients throughout the life cycle of the project. (newline) To do this, developers need a working knowledge of the software to be able to balance what the client wants with what the software can actually provide. They also need to have great attention to detail to ensure the project is running smoothly. (newline) Software engineers, on the other hand, are the ones who actually build the software systems. As such, they are much more hands-on during the development process, working to apply engineering principles to the creation and testing of the product. (newline) Where developers might help find solutions to specific problems, engineers are responsible for the system as a whole. Engineers must look for solutions that will work across the entire program, rather than just one area. (newline) It should be noted that because software engineers are required to have a higher level of technical skill than developers, itâs often easier for an engineer to work as a developer than the other way around.Â (newline) But thereâs another way to differentiate between the two as well.Â (newline) Developers often work on the parts of code that deal directly with the clientâs experience. Theyâre changing things like the color of the platform, the location of a particular button or data entry field, or what the website or application looks like when transitioning tasks. (newline) Theyâre working primarily with languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other forward-facing programming languages. (newline) All of these coded elements will be directly seen and noticed by the client or user. (newline) Software engineers are working on problems that wonât be necessarily seen by the client or end user but will affect their user experience. (newline) Theyâre deciding how userâs data should be collected, where and how it should be stored, how to recall that data when itâs needed later, and the most efficient ways to analyze or manipulate it. (newline) No one is seeing all of this number-crunching going on, but if the code isnât right, the user is going to see it pretty quickly. (newline) Think of office software. If you worked at a hospital and needed to pull the data for everyone who ever worked with the 20-year hospital veteran, âDr. Cho,â and you only got two results back, thatâd be a major red flag. (newline) Thereâs just no way that doctor has only ever seen 2 patients in 20 years. (newline) This is where good, backend, software engineering comes into play. And software engineering usually focuses on languages like Python, Java, and ruby. (newline) This is also why there isnât a huge difference between backend developers and software engineers. There may be a slight difference between client interaction time, but other than that, title choice happens on a company-by-company basis. (newline) Training (newline) Whether theyâre looking to become a software engineer or developer, many prospective software professionals feel like their education has to start at the same: computer science degree programs. (newline) A bachelorâs degree that focuses on coding and software â including, but not limited to, computer science â will not only provide the necessary software education, but the degree could help you get your foot in the door when it comes to employment. (newline) That said, while software engineers are often expected to have more education than developers, you donât need a degree to start working in either field. And if youâre not sure about committing at least four years of your life (and a whole lot of money) to a college education, you should know that you have other options. (newline) One of the growing trends in tech-related education is coding bootcamps, which can provide a base-level education for a fraction of the cost and time. Some bootcamps offer certification, another way to get your foot in the door. But, again, certificates arenât the only factor in getting a job, so donât let that limit your learning. (newline) Coding bootcamps can be a valuable alternative to a college degree. To learn more about whatâs available, check out the Devmountain course list. (newline) Whether youâre in a degree program or a bootcamp, itâs also worth getting to know other coders. You can do this in person with friends or classmates, or you can find coding communities online. Interacting with people can keep you motivated, help you learn outside of a classroom setting, and provide you with valuable advice. (newline) Furthermore, while learning concepts is important, youâll also want to spend time creating finished projects for a portfolio. For software engineers, this should include a wide variety of projects to showcase your range. (newline) Youâll want to show youâre not just adept in C++, but also Java, Ruby, Python, etc. On the other hand, software developers are often encouraged to specialize. If you want to do website development, for instance, make sure you have several examples of your website work. (newline) Regardless of how you go about getting a coding education, what really matters is what you learn, what you create, and how you approach problem-solving. (newline) Who Makes More? Software Developers or Software Engineers? (newline) So whatâs the difference in salary between software developers and software engineers? (newline) Isnât that the question? (newline) Unfortunately, we donât have a good answer for that. (newline) There are so many variables to take into account. (newline) What does the local job market look like? (newline) How developed is that department in the company? (newline) What kind of work is the person doing? (newline) Are they client-side or working internally? (newline) Does the company distinguish between backend devs and software engineers? (newline) What do other companies in the area pay for these kinds of positions? (newline) All of these questions (and many many more) will affect that end salary. (newline) If youâre wanting to find more information about company pay, weâd suggest you look to the US Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ Occupational Outlook Handbook for local and national pay averages and Glassdoor for self-reported salaries from current and former employees. (newline) These numbers wonât be perfect, but theyâll be better than any answer we could share with you. (newline) Interview (newline) Because of the overlap between software developers and software engineers, it should come as no surprise that there are often similarities in the interview process as well. You should definitely come prepared with a portfolio; employers like to see your past work. (newline) And your resume should also reflect the kind of position youâre gunning for. Most people make the mistake of having only one technical resume and applying to both developer and engineering jobs with it. (newline) But if youâre applying for a software engineering job, your resume should highlight big, across-the-board problems that you solved. If youâre applying for a software developer job, then your resume should feature how you interacted with and solved specific issues in specific instances. (newline) If youâre interviewing, you should also be prepared to tackle questions that test how you think. Developers are often expected to prove they can think creatively, while engineers usually need to prove they can tackle problems using mathematical and scientific approaches. (newline) You should also research what employers are expecting from your work in the posted job position. (newline) Because thereâs overlap between the fields of software development and engineering (remember, some experts no longer bother making a distinction between the two), what an employer expects you to do might not line up with what youâre anticipating. (newline) If youâve trained to be a software engineer, for instance, are you prepared to dip your toe into the world of development? Would you want to? (newline) The best advice for individuals considering software development or engineering is to find their niche. With a little ingenuity and some hard work, making the jump between disciplines is possible so find what you like doing and make it work for you! (newline) Interested In Getting into Development Or Engineering? (newline) Thinking about breaking into tech but not sure what your focus should be? (newline) Try taking our Coding Basics course.

(newline) What Does a Software Engineer Do? (newline) What image comes to your mind when you think âSoftware Engineer?â (newline) A super-genius-type who creates things out of thin air – like Bill Gates or Alan Turing? Or someone in a dark room, listening to techno music and typing furiously on the computer – like in The Matrix? (newline) Maybe you envision a corporate-style engineer – wearing headphones and going to scrum meetings in an office. Or a freelance âdigital nomadâ engineer who codes from a cafe on the beach. (newline) A software engineer uses computer science principles to develop software solutions that will satisfy the wants and needs of businesses and consumers. Software engineers create many types of solutions such as desktop and web applications, mobile apps, games, robots, operating systems, network systems, etc. They do so using programming languages, frameworks, databases, servers and other technologies to turn an idea into a final product. (newline) Because software engineers work on many types of projects, they also take on varying job roles, responsibilities, and even personas – like all the images we described above.

(newline) How to become a software engineer (newline) First, software developer vs software engineer – what gives? (newline) In the industry, the terms âsoftware developerâ and âsoftware engineerâ are used interchangeably. We will also use them interchangeably in this article. But since this is a common question, hereâs a quick explanation for what is the difference between a software developer vs. software engineer: (newline) A software engineer is someone who applies computer science and engineering concepts to create software solutions. A software engineer understands why the code works, and the best, most efficient way to write it. (newline) On the other hand, a software developer is the creative driving force behind making the solution come to life. (newline) In more concrete terms, a software engineer architects software solutions by making plans and designing the system, so the software developer can build the solution with code. (newline) There is a whole thread on Reddit on this topic, with the responses varying from: (newline) âIt doesnât matter at all.â (newline) To: âIn Canada you have to be licensed (i.e. have a degree which says Engineering) to have Engineer in your title.â (newline) And our favorite: âMy acceptance letter said âSoftware Developerâ, but one day, I decided to change my job title on our website to âEngineerâ. That was like 2 years ago and nobody has noticed and/or cared.â (newline) We agree that âengineerâ has a bit more weight to it than âdeveloper,â but for simplicityâs sake weâll use them interchangeably. So now: What do software engineers do? (newline) ï»¿ (newline) via GIPHY (newline) What does a software engineer do – Responsibilities (newline) Software engineers support the product delivery process to take a project from its goals and requirements to the final product. (newline) Here are sample responsibilities taken from job postings on Indeed.com: (newline) Software Engineer at a Fintech company (newline) Design, implement, test and maintain logic and components. (newline) Design and build systems with automated instrumentation and monitoring. (newline) Consistently improve maintainability and stability of the codebase. (newline) Collaborate with Product & Business Operations teams to translate business requirements and build highly robust and scalable products. (newline) Backend Web Developer at a startup (newline) Collaborate with front-end developers to resolve API issues. (newline) Develop and maintain secure and stateless web services. (newline) Build reusable code and libraries for future use. (newline) Analyze and debug issues in a complex client/server environment. (newline) Data Engineer (newline) Help build robust data pipelines and ETL tools. (newline) Address and predict data performance bottlenecks. (newline) Retrieve and aggregate data from multiple sources into a digestible and actionable format. (newline) Identify, design, and implement internal process improvements: automating manual processes, optimizing data delivery, re-designing infrastructure for greater scalability. (newline) A day in the life of a Software Engineer (newline) If you thought that engineers spent all their time coding, like this cat, think again! (newline) via GIPHY (newline) We collected the daily routines of various software engineers from here, here and here to create this sample representation of what a software engineer does on a day-to-day basis. (newline) Just like there is no single recipe to make spaghetti, even a âtypical dayâ in the life of software engineers always comes with new twists and interesting problems to solve. (newline) 7:30 am – Wake up (newline) Not all software engineers wake up early. But most, especially those with families, prefer to spend early hours in the office and have the evenings to themselves. For those working from an office, arriving early also helps beat rush hour traffic! (newline) 8:30 am – Reach office and check email (newline) Especially with todayâs global teams, there is almost always someone working on or using your product when you are asleep. And if new tasks come up, or something breaks during the night? You know about it the second you check your email. (newline) 9:00 am – Start coding (newline) Writing code can be as creative as writing a story, and requires intense concentration to work effectively. This is why many developers wear headphones when working – to cancel out external noise and signal that you prefer not to be disturbed. (newline) 11:30 am – Daily / Weekly standup meeting (newline) Many effective engineering teams use the Agile method of development, where teams meet regularly to discuss their tasks and requirements to keep forward momentum. These meetings last between 15-60 minutes, depending on the team size and frequency of the meetings. (newline) 12:15 pm – Hunger strikes! (newline) Whether you work for a large corporation that offers catered lunches, or a small startup where you leave the office to grab lunch, engineers find it important to take breaks to eat and rest during the day. (newline) 1:30 pm – Back to coding, usually with coffee/ tea (newline) This is the part where the engineer goes back to coding or solving bugs. Again, it is usually a long time before the engineer resurfaces. (newline) 4:00 pm – Collaboration meetings (newline) Technology is constantly evolving and improving, so even when products are âcompleteâ they must be constantly refined to fit new user needs, the latest in cybersecurity, and the latest technologies. Building software with a team requires meeting with clients or teammates – something that many software engineers detest, but a necessity for getting the job done. (newline) 6:00 pm – Send emails and wrap up for the day (newline) Usually, engineers send emails to their counterparts about what they completed that day, reply to any another email that may have come up during the day, and then close their computers to enjoy the rest of their day. (newline) Itâs not all coding! (newline) As you can see, a developer spends time doing many other tasks than just writing code. According to a survey conducted by Electric Cloud, developers spend up to 54% of their time on non-coding tasks. (newline) While the exact time spent on these tasks varies based on the development phase, the graphic below depicts what software engineers do in an average week. (newline) Image Source: Infoworld (newline) Software engineer career paths (newline) There are many different career paths for software engineers beyond coding jobs. As a result, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that jobs for software engineers will grow by 21% in the next ten years. The predicted growth rate for all occupations comes in at only 5%. (newline) Below weâve outlined some of the most common software engineer career paths, and what a software engineer does in these roles: (newline) Web Developer (newline) Web developers create websites and applications to present information and services on the web. A Front-end web developer ensures that information is readable and engaging with a good user experience. Back-end web developers ensure proper functionality, and that applications are quick to load across devices, internet connection speeds, and languages. (newline) Mobile Developer (newline) Mobile developers build applications for iOS and Android mobile operating systems. They ensure that the same application works seamlessly across different screen sizes, operating system versions, and platforms. (newline) Test & Quality Assurance Engineer (newline) Quality assurance engineers are responsible for catching bugs in the code and ensuring that the codebase is of high quality. (newline) Systems Engineer (newline) Systems engineers create systems that are a blend of hardware and software. They focus on larger issues in the design and creation of systems, such as requirements, reliability, performance, maintenance, and logistics. (newline) Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist (newline) Data scientists use statistics and machine learning algorithms to solve critical business problems. Their main strength lies in clearly explaining their findings so that businesses can make informed decisions. (newline) Data Engineer (newline) Data engineers prepare the data to be consumed by data scientists. Some of their duties include getting the data from the source, cleaning it, transforming it and storing it so that it can be efficiently accessed and used by others. (newline) Database Administrator (newline) Database administrators design and maintain databases. Some of their duties include troubleshooting issues with the database, recovering data, and creating access control protocols. (newline) Project Manager (newline) Project managers oversee a project end-to-end, from planning to procurement to the execution of a project. While not all project managers are software engineers, they benefit from having engineering knowledge and skills to effectively plan and work with engineers for project delivery. Project managers are usually the first point of contact for any issues or discrepancies in the project. (newline) Product Manager/Owner (newline) Product owners are responsible for having a vision of the product that needs to be built, and conveying that vision to the development team. They understand the market, the customer and the business, and why the product needs to be what it is. Once again, not all product managers/owners need to be engineers, but they can seriously benefit from these skills. (newline) Scrum Master (newline) A scrum master facilitates the development process for an Agile development team. Some of their duties include removing obstacles that are impeding the team’s progress, and helping the team reach consensus for what can be achieved during a specific period. (newline) Software engineer salaries (newline) It is no secret that software engineers are some of the highest-paid employees across the world. The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the median salary of software engineers in the United States at $88,000 per year. (newline) So what does a software engineer do to make so much money? Oftentimes tasks that are highly complex and specialized, as well as tasks that can impact millions of people. This is why they get paid the big bucks! (newline) You can see the varying salaries by career path in the graphic below. (newline) Data source: Payscale (newline) Software engineer salaries around the world (newline) For an idea of what software engineers around the world can expect to make on average, see the graphic below: (newline) Image source: Daxx (newline) Software Engineer Requirements (newline) Obviously strong coding skills are required for the job, but what else does a software engineer do to secure a great job? Every coder must also possess certain soft skills to qualify for todayâs software engineering jobs. Weâve listed them in no particular order, and this list is by no means exhaustive. But if you feel comfortable conveying several of the attributes below, you will be in good shape to get a software engineering job: (newline) Good communication skills (newline) Knowledge of at least one programming language (newline) Aptitude for logical thinking and problem solving (newline) Grit – the ability to stay motivated in a challenging and constantly evolving environment (newline) Understanding of the software development process (newline) Creativity to develop software from ideas (newline) Good analytical skills to understand usersâ needs and develop a solution for them (newline) Culture Fit / Likeability – companies want to work with people theyâll enjoy working with (newline) Ability to write good tests (newline) Understanding of computers and computer systems (newline) Youâll notice that we did not include a university degree in Computer Science or engineering-related field. Although you may see this on many software engineer job descriptions, the truth is that the demand for engineers far outpaces the number of engineers with university degrees. This causes hiring managers to value the skills you have over your university credentials – another reason why intensive software engineering training courses like CodingNomads exists! (newline) Industries that employ software engineers (newline) With the rise of digital services, almost every industry worldwide employs software engineers. Some examples of industries and the type of project that a software engineer may handle are listed below – (newline) Finance: (newline) Create a trading platform so that investment bankers at firms like Goldman Sachs can conduct their trading. (newline) Healthcare: (newline) Analyze patient data to provide better healthcare and create systems that increase the efficiency of the healthcare process. (newline) Retail: (newline) Help retail stores like Walmart or Target create and maintain their online shopping website. (newline) Government: (newline) Ensure that super-sensitive data remains safe and unhackable. (newline) Human resources: (newline) From automated resume scanners to applicant tracking systems, software engineers create many systems to ease the life of recruiters. (newline) Energy: (newline) Create the systems that track energy produced and consumed around the world. (newline) Real Estate, Transportation, Science, Space Exploration and so many more! (newline) To give you an idea of some numbers, here is a chart created by iDataLabs on the volume and distribution of companies using Python by industry. (newline) Image source: iDataLabs (newline) What do software engineers love/hate about their jobs? (newline) When asking various software engineers about their favorite – and least favorite – aspects of their jobs, we got a lot of lively responses. (newline) What do software engineers love about their jobs? â¤ï¸ (newline) Stephanie: âI love pair/mob programming, as I can be social in addition to learning a lot from others…â (newline) Anonymous: âThe thrill of actual real people using the software I made/contributed to [which] helps them in some wayâ¦â (newline) Toshia: âI love the culture where I work. I love being treated as an equal, respected, trusted, and heard…I love a flexible work schedule, that allows me to work from home as needed, and Iâm trusted to get my job done with no one watching my âclocked hours.â (newline) Laura: âDesigning and implementing solutions to problems. I find it very satisfying to solve the puzzles I encounter every day.â (newline) What do software engineers dislike about their jobs? ð (newline) We received several anonymous responses from women about male/female discrepancies in the workplace such as, âOnly men get promoted,â and âSomething that I have [to] deal with daily is the “bro culture”, it’s just disappointing and frustrating.â (newline) Others talked about work-life balance struggles: (newline) âWhat I dislike about the role is there is no work life balance, you are working 12-14 hr daysâ¦â (newline) âMost companies say they care about work life balance or inclusion but you don’t see them making efforts in that direction. For example, I was coding and the ergonomic software I had installed that reminds to blink your eyes came up and my boss went “Does that not disturb your work?” (newline) âBad documentation is the worst! â¦but I also hate writing documentation.â ð (newline) Youâll notice that some responses in the love category also had equal and opposite responses in the hate category. This highlights how much company culture and leadership can impact a software engineering environment. (newline) How to become a software engineer (newline) Most people become software engineers either by getting a university degree, attending a coding bootcamp, or learning on you own. (newline) While a university degree is always an asset for finding work, todayâs university programs do not adequately prepare graduates for the day-to-day tasks required of professional software engineers. CodingNomadsâ Cofounder and Java Curriculum Developer Ryan Desmond agrees from his experience: (newline) Even after receiving my Computer Science degree, I felt like I had to Google every aspect of my job. My first few months consisted of many sleepless nights trying to figure out basic engineering tasks like spinning up servers. Sleepless nights, and a lot of coffee! âRyan Desmond, CodingNomads. (newline) University education also takes years to complete, and especially in the US, can cost tens of thousands of dollars. And given the demand for engineers, many employers place more importance on the skills you have than a university degree. These combined drawbacks of university education led to the rise of coding bootcamps as a viable option for breaking into engineering. (newline) Coding bootcamps are intensive software engineering training programs that students complete in months. According to Course Report, the average tuition price of in-person courses in the United States $13,584, with an average program length of 15.1 weeks. (newline) Without the overhead of a physical year-round location, CodingNomads provide a more affordable alternative to other US bootcamps, offering Java and Python training curriculum both in-person and online for a fraction of the average US price. (newline) Although coding bootcamps can accelerate your learning (and getting a paying job!), they do still cost money. (newline) This leads to the third most common way that people become software engineers – by learning on your own. As you probably already know, you can learn to code online with free / low cost resources like Youtube, courses like Harvard CS50, and forums like Reddit and StackOverflow. If you are self-motivated and disciplined enough, you can indeed learn to code entirely for free. (newline) No matter which way you choose to learn to code, we always encourage starting online for free. This way, you can see if you like coding before investing (or wasting!) time and money on a course. To get started learning for free, you can preview our Java and Python online courses on our online learning platform. (newline) What do software engineers do? Lots of things! (newline) Software engineering is applied in endless ways – from various day-to-day responsibilities, career paths, industries, skills requirements, and even the way you learn it. (newline) With so many avenues to explore, sometimes itâs helpful to learn what NOT to doâ¦ Keep reading to learn about what NOT to do when learning to code.

Software Developer vs Software Engineer: The Difference You Need to Know - DistantJob - Remote Recruitment Agency (newline) Hire Now (newline) Remote Tech Jobs (newline) Blog (newline) Our Podcast (newline) About Us (newline) Contact Us (newline) Hire Now (newline) Remote Tech Jobs (newline) Blog (newline) Our Podcast (newline) About Us (newline) Contact Us (newline) Evaluating Remote Tech Candidates (newline) Software Developer vs Software Engineer: The Difference You Need to Know (newline) Jori Hamilton (newline) Published July 4, 2022 (newline) - (newline) 3 min. to read (newline) Are you in a position to recruit a software developer for your new project? Or do you need a software engineer? Without a technical background, it is quite challenging to identify the difference between software engineers vs software developers. (newline) These positions are similar but are responsible for very different parts of software creation and while there is some overlap, they have different responsibilities, focuses, and skills. (newline) The core difference between software developer and software engineer is the scale at which their work affects a project. Engineers are concerned with the overall structure, developing a high-level view of the project, and defining the specifics of how each piece fits together. Software developers, on the other hand, are focused on building individual portions or processes within a program and are responsible for making sure that they fit together. In short, engineers work on a macro-level view of the project, while developers work on a micro-level. (newline) While both are necessary and have some requisite overlap, they are distinctly different. (newline) Software Engineer: Overview (newline) Software engineers are involved in the early stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC), where the purpose and scope of a project are defined. They also build prototypes, define parameters, and determine the technical needs of the project they are working on. This may include determining how many developers are needed for a given project, setting budgets, and working with project managers to delegate workloads to different groups. (newline) Software Developer: Overview (newline) Where engineers are most heavily involved in the process closer to the beginning of the SDLC, software developers are in the thick of it, building, testing, and iterating the program. Each individual has less responsibility than the project engineers and, in larger companies, will work on a specific portion of the program. (newline) In video game development, for example, developers may be hired for a hyper-specific skillset such as character movement. In the meantime, another team focuses on programming, building environments, and character styles. These teams will still report to engineers and update progress, but their overall scope of responsibility and focus is much narrower. (newline) Software Developer vs. Software Engineer (newline) One of the reasons that people confuse software engineers vs software developers is because their jobs can have considerable overlap. This comes from the necessary skills and knowledge software engineers require, and the fact that many software developers become engineers over the course of their careers. (newline) They share similar work environments, working both onsite and remotely, and by nature work for the same types of companies. (newline) Whatâs the difference? (newline) The main difference is in the scope of their work and the level of responsibility that individual developers and engineers have. (newline) A software engineer models software that can be built to specification by designing and building the structures necessary for software development. To do so, they must be able to understand the individual components of a design and their functional connections, as well as understand the extension of their developersâ abilities and software functionality. (newline) A software developer will often be given a portion of a project to complete and will report to the engineer or a head developer who will interface with the engineer. (newline) In small companies and startups, smaller teams can mean that an engineer will also take on developer responsibilities and vice-versa. This is the main reason why both roles often get confused. (newline) Roles, Responsibilities, and Practices of Software Developers (newline) Software Developers are responsible for programming the software and its systems, as designed by an Engineer. As such, their main responsibilities are: (newline) Programming : software developers should be knowledgeable of algorithms and programming structures that are commonly used in the field the software theyâre developing is aimed at. This helps develop code in accordance with best practices that can be used and easily integrated with the code authored by the rest of the team. Code versioning: (newline) Developers should be comfortable and proficient with a code versioning tool of the teamâs choice. Itâs a standard practice that helps organize work, roll back any undesired changes with minimal effort, or develop parts of the code independently from the rest of the team to minimize disruption. Use IDEs and their tools: (newline) IDEs nowadays are far from being a simple programs, and provide many tools that help improve and streamline a developerâs job, such as debugging, refactoring, and providing useful code statistics. Savvy software developers should know how to use these tools to their advantage and deliver the best code possible. (newline) Roles, Responsibilities, and Practices of Software Engineers (newline) Software Engineers are responsible for a more broad view of a software development project. As such, they have the following responsibilities: (newline) Design and Problem-Solving : An engineer is tasked first and foremost with designing the various systems and components a software needs to function. Software is developed to solve a problem, and it can only do so with a thoughtful and coherent design. Learn Programming : Much like a developer, an engineer should also know algorithms and programming structures, but with a different goal in mind. Unlike the developer, they donât put that knowledge into actual practice, but rather learn it so they can design software in a way that is then doable and achievable by the projectâs programmers. Communicate with the team : While a developer can be left to their own devices once their tasks have been set, an engineer needs to be in constant communication with the team to make sure they understand the design and develop it according to specifications. (newline) Engineers have more responsibility in a software development project, so itâs important you have capable people filling the role. When hiring, make specific questions to evaluate a candidateâs software engineer skills reliably.

(newline) Software developers may work on a team that falls under the umbrella of the engineering department or have their own separate department. Developers report to project managers and engineers as the progress of their work dictates when the product will be ready. In this way, software developers are the most important component in software creation. (newline) Engineers are a must for any type of software creation. Whether they are a developer who is expanding their skills and beginning to work at a higher level, or a dedicated engineer, without a person to lead the creation of purpose, design, and deliberation, there is no program to build. Engineers interface with project managers, software developers, managers, and marketing teams. They keep other departments updated on timelines, help delineate work, and communicate expectations. In this way, software could not be created without engineers. (newline) There may be overlap in the responsibilities of each of these positions, but ultimately they are both necessary for building new and improved programs. (newline) If youâre looking to fill one of these positions, whether itâs a software developer or a software engineer, you can check this article on top of interview questions if youâre hiring remotely or count on us to do the work for you. At DistantJob, weâve been helping companies find and hire the best software developers and IT talent in a blink of an eye.Â (newline) 1. Is a software engineer the same as a software developer? (newline) No. A software engineer can (and usually will) have a developer background, but they also have a much wider view of the project and define its architecture and thus more responsibilities. A developer is tasked by an engineer with building the systems that make part of the whole software. (newline) 2. Which is better: software developer or software engineer? (newline) Ultimately, engineers and developers have distinctly different sets of skills, levels of responsibility, and scopes of focus. None is strictly better, as both are necessary for a project to be completed successfully.With software as a service (SaaS) becoming key to succeeding in every industry from fleet management to small businesses, skilled developers and engineers are necessary for keeping up with demand. Like an architect and a carpenter, both are paramount to the construction of new, exciting solutions and technologies.Â (newline) 3. Who is paid more: software engineer or software developer? (newline) Due to their increased responsibilities, software engineers earn slightly more than developers (values taken from Talent.comâs job salary search):Software Developers earn on average $100k /yearSoftware Engineers earn on average $110k /yearSenior Software Engineers earn on average about $127k /yearAll these values will vary depending on the location of the company and if youâre hiring remotely, the location of the person as well.

By (newline) Ian Bogost Andrew Brookes / CorbisNovember 5, 2015Share Iâm commiserating with a friend who recently left the technology industry to return to entertainment. âIâm not a programmer,â he begins, explaining some of the frustrations of his former workplace, before correcting himself, ââoh, engineer, in tech-bro speak. Though to me, engineers are people who build bridges and follow pretty rigid processes for a reason.â (newline) His indictment touches a nerve. In the Silicon Valley technology scene, itâs common to use the bare term âengineerâ to describe technical workers. Somehow, everybody who isnât in sales, marketing, or design became an engineer. âWeâre hiring engineers,â read startup websites, which could mean anything from Javascript programmers to roboticists. (newline) Read Follow-Up (newline) Notes (newline) Ian Responds to Reader Reaction (newline) The term is probably a shortening of âsoftware engineer,â but its use betrays a secret: âEngineerâ is an aspirational title in software development. Traditional engineers are regulated, certified, and subject to apprenticeship and continuing education. Engineering claims an explicit responsibility to public safety and reliability, even if it doesnât always deliver. (newline) The title âengineerâ is cheapened by the tech industry. (newline) Recent years have seen prominent failures in software. Massive data breaches at Target, Home Depot, BlueCross BlueShield, Anthem, Harvard University, LastPass, and Ashley Madison only scratch the surface of the cybersecurity issues posed by todayâs computer systems. The Volkswagen diesel-emissions exploit was caused by a software failing, even if it seems to have been engineered, as it were, deliberately. Recommended Reading The Real Reason Silicon Valley Coders Write Bad Software (newline) Bernard Meisler (newline) The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage (newline) Michael S. Teitelbaum (newline) Can a Kids' Toy Bring More Women Into Engineering? (newline) Rebecca J. Rosen (newline) But these problems are just the most urgent and most memorable. Todayâs computer systems pose individual and communal dangers that weâd never accept in more concrete structures like bridges, skyscrapers, power plants, and missile-defense systems. Appleâs iOS 9 update reportedly âbrickedâ certain phones, making them unusable. Services like Google Docs go down for mysterious reasons, leaving those whose work depends on them in a lurch. âYour password contains invalid characters,â a popular tweet quotes from an anonymous website, before twisting the dagger, âNo, your startup contains incompetent engineers.â (newline) These might seem like minor matters compared to the structural integrity of your office building or the security of our nationâs nuclear-weapons arsenal. But then consider how often your late-model car fails to start inexplicably or your office elevator traps you inside its shaft. Computing has become infrastructure, but it doesnât work like infrastructure. (newline) When it comes to skyscrapers and bridges and power plants and elevators and the like, engineering has been, and will continue to be, managed partly by professional standards, and partly by regulation around the expertise and duties of engineers. But fifty yearsâ worth of attempts to turn software development into a legitimate engineering practice have failed. (newline) Just as the heavy industry can greenwash to produce the appearance of environmental responsibility and the consumer industry can pinkwash to connect themselves to cause marketing, so the technology industry can âengineerwashââleveraging the legacy of engineering in order to make their products and services appear to engender trust, competence, and service in the public interest. * * * By the 1960s, large national-defense systems were largely managed by computers. But the creation of such systems was a disasterâalmost everything was delivered late, over budget, and with unnecessary complexity. Late in the decade, the NATO Science Committee sponsored two conferences dedicated to establishing an engineering approach to software creation. The 1968 conference report shows that the notion was still aspirational: (newline) The phrase âsoftware engineeringâ was deliberately chosen as being provocative, in implying the need for software manufacture to be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines, that are traditional in the established branches of engineering. (newline) Commercial applications meant to service ordinary people, from inventory control to airline reservations to banking, needed to be reliable. Programming merely involved implementation. (newline) Software-engineering trends came and went during the ensuing decades. Structured programming paradigms of the 1960s, meant to make software development more predictable and less risky, gave way to the object-oriented paradigm of the â80s and â90s, meant to make programming better mirror the business processes it facilitates. (newline) Meanwhile, the overall challenges of software engineering became more familiar and more entrenched. A decade after his 1975 intervention The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, Fred Brooks lamented that little had changed. In response, he proposed incremental development, or prototyping. Todayâs software development is iterative, and for good reason: Software wasnât ever really akin to manufacturing and construction, where changes were difficult or impossible after initial implementation. Computing is turning engineering into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling. But, software was never not akin to manufacturing and construction, either. Almost 50 years after the NATO Science Committee conferences, some of its participantsâ warnings still hold. âIn the competitive rush to make available the latest techniques,â the â68 report opines, âwe strive to take great forward leaps across gulfs of unknown width and depth.â The same sentiment still holds today. (newline) So, what happened? The personal-computer revolution, for one. In the 1960s and â70s, computers were expensive and scarce. They were confined to research, in governmental, corporate, and industrial contexts. But with the rise of the microcomputer in the late 1970s, anyone could own, use, and program one. (newline) This democratization of software development ignited the consumer and business-software revolution. But it also changed the stakes of software engineering. Developing Microsoft Excel or the back-office systems at American Airlines was hardly glamorous or fast-paced. A giant product like a spreadsheet or a reservation system was still something like a bridge or a building: It had to work right, especially since patches and revisions were expensive and required physical intervention. Such cases require an engineering approach, while trying oneâs hand at a program for upload to the local BBS (or the modern app store) does not. (newline) The informality of software development accelerated even more with the rise of the web, starting in the mid â90s and continuing through today. As software services moved to websites, smartphones, and the Cloud, two things happened. (newline) First, the pressure to get things right the first time around was relieved, because updates and changes could be applied centrally, as in the mainframe era. Over time, the ease of rapid repair became an excuse for rapid development, and Brooks-style prototyping mutated into the constant software updates we experience today. Facebook has wisely retired its one-time internal-development philosophy, âmove fast and break things,â but no business reliant on civil or structural engineering would ever have adopted such a motto in the first place. (newline) And second, software became more isolated from the world, even as it became more predominant. Earlier computing systems were imbricated with other aspects of business, industry, government, and society. An automobile customer-management system has to integrate with dealers, suppliers, shippers, banks and lenders, regulators, legacy systems, and customers. But todayâs software mostly stands alone. Instagram, a photo-sharing service valued at $35 billion last year, just uploads and downloads images between its servers and its app. (newline) To be sure, todayâs Cloud-connected tools still rely on infrastructures, especially the physical servers and networks that handle millions of users accessing billions of files. But those activities have largely been outsourced to infrastructure giants. (newline) Likewise, integrations with messaging, financials, and storage have been abstracted such that individual software developers can treat them as black boxes. That sometimes allows software to run better and more reliably, but it also allows developers to avoid interfacing with the messy world outside their co-working spaces. (newline) As a result, software development has become institutionally hermetic. And thatâs the opposite of what âengineeringâ ought to mean: a collaboration with the world, rather than a separate domain bent on overtaking it. * * * The traditional disciplines of engineeringâcivil, mechanical, aerospace, chemical, electrical, environmentalâare civic professions as much as technical ones. Engineers orchestrate the erection of bridges and buildings; they design vehicles and heavy machinery; they invent and realize the energy systems that drive this equipment; and they contrive methods for connecting all of these systems together. (newline) Itâs no accident that the most truly engineered of software-engineering projects extend well beyond the computer. Autonomous-vehicle design offers the most obvious contemporary example. When Google designs self-driving cars, it musters its own computational systems, like mapping and navigation. But it also integrates those into a world much larger than browsers and smartphones and data centers. Autonomous vehicles share the roads with human-driven cars, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Those roads are managed, maintained, and regulated. Self-driving cars also interface with federal motor-vehicle standards and regulations, along with all the other material demands and foibles of a machine made of metal and plastic and rubber rather than bits. Engineering addresses complex, large-scale systems. (newline) This is why it is so infuriating when Uber insists that it is just a technology platform, and thus not subject to the oversight of transportation-services regulation. Love or hate it, Uber is not just an app developerâitâs a car-service network activated by software, and thus subject to public interest and oversight. And no matter what Uber says, the company still advertises careers in âengineering, design, and productâ categories on its website. Engineering roles are illustrated by a bearded guy staring at source code on two monitors. Uber Screenshot Other engineering disciplines are subject to certification and licensure. If youâve ever hired a civil, structural, or hydraulic engineer for a construction or repair project, that individual probably had to be certified as a Professional Engineer (PE). Licensing processes vary by state, but Professional Engineers generally need to hold a 4-year degree from an accredited program in their discipline, pass one or more exams, and possess 4 or more years of professional experience under the supervision of a licensed engineer. Not all working engineers are or need to be Professional Engineers, but to open an engineering consulting practice or to claim that one is an âengineerâ in a formal context, licensure is usually required. Itâs in the stateâs interest to ensure that someone claiming to be an engineer (or an architect a surveyor or a cosmetologist or a massage therapist) isnât just making up his or her qualifications. (newline) Professional Engineering certification is usually offered only in fields where something could go terribly, horribly wrong with unqualified actors at the helm. California, for example, issues Professional licenses for agricultural, chemical, civil, control system, electrical, fire protection, industrial, mechanical, metallurgical, nuclear, petroleum engineering, and traffic engineers. (newline) In 2013, the National Council of Examiners of Engineers and Surveyors (NCEES), which all 50 states use for licensure examination, began offering testing for software engineers. The exams were produced in collaboration with the IEEE, who maintains a Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). (newline) But itâs unlikely that Silicon Valley workers would pursue such a license. For one, software engineers are unlikely to open a private office like a structural engineer might do. Even if all engineers are supposed to work under a licensed engineer to use the name, at big companies, many do so under layers of management. (newline) The information-technology industry simply doesnât value certification as much as engineering does, or even as much as IT once did. Silicon Valley bigwigs like Peter Thiel have been flouting formal degrees for years, and even big companies like Google have indicated that they donât value a college degree over and above the ability to do whatever work Google decides is important. (newline) But by definition, âengineeringâ has traditionally entailed the completion of an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-approved 4-year degree. ABETâs accreditation requirements for computer science are vague, but they do expect âan ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity.â (newline) Accredited computer-science programs might be moving further away from software engineering anyway. Agile software development has become predominant, focused on rapid iteration rather than long-term planning and intricate documentation. One popular agile method is Scrum, which is focused on short âsprintsâ toward a series of changing goals. Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise emanates from that responsibility. Lightweight approaches like Scrum are more compatible with the fast-moving marketplace of computer technology. An app or a web service isnât a bridge or a building. Software is temporary, and provisionalism is considered a feature, not a bug. But at the same time, the stakes of software development are becoming akin to that of bridges and buildings. Not only do computers run our cars and airplanes and medical devices, but also our banking systems, health-care organizations, insurance-underwriting practices, telephony and communication networksâeven our social and entertainment activities. And even if successful, methodologies like Scrum never allow that infrastructure to stabilize. Some new tweak can be made, some new feature can always be added. (newline) Meanwhile, start-up culture is changing engineering education anyway. Entrepreneurship is exalted. Accelerators and incubators abound. Not all students in computer-science programs think theyâll become startup billionairesâ¦ But not all of them donât think so, either. Would-be âengineersâ are encouraged to think of every project as a potential business ready to scale and sell, rather than as a process of long-term training in disciplines where concerns for social welfare become paramount. Engineering has always been a well-paid profession, but computing is turning it into a type of speculative finance rather than a calling. * * * The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) calls the âengineersâ who work at Google and Uber and Facebook and its ilk âComputer Programmersâ or âSoftware Developers.â The former write code, the latter design systems. Nobody has to follow the BLSâs definitions, and you can understand why more grandiose titles would be appealing to Silicon Valley disruptors. âEngineerâ conjures the image of the hard-hat-topped designer-builder, carefully crafting tomorrow. But such an aspiration is rarely realized by computing. The respectability of engineering, a feature built over many decades of closely controlled, education- and apprenticeship-oriented certification, becomes reinterpreted as a fast-and-loose commitment to craftwork as business. (newline) Engineerwashing entails a shift from the noun to the verbal sense of âengineer.â An engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains systems. But to engineer means skillfully, artfully, or even deviously contriving an outcome. To engineer is to jury-rig, to get something working more or less, for a time. Sufficiently enough that it serves an immediately obvious purpose, but without concern or perhaps even awareness of its longevity. Engineering in this sense embodies MacGyver scrappiness, a doggedness compatible with todayâs values of innovative disruption. But then, no reasonable person would want MacGyver building their bridges or buildings. Or software! (newline) Perhaps software calamities like data breaches and dieselgate will raise the hackles of the public, such that the standards for software development will be revealed and, in time, reformed. But given the difficulty of renewing, creating, or enforcing more urgent regulatory oversight over the technology industry, the job titles of technology workers probably seems like a minor matter. (newline) Just as Silicon Valley has deftly reframed its business interests as a process of âchanging the world,â so it has also reframed engineering as a process of building something temporary. After all, professionals like graphic designers and hedge-fund managers also build things, but we donât normally call them engineers (brand engineering? speculation engineering?). They do work that might or might not be infrastructural, and that might or might not be conducted in the public interest. And those latter matters are what separate engineering from mere business or craft. (newline) All of which leads us back to the bridges to which my friend negatively compared his âengineerâ colleagues. In Canada, many civil engineers wear an iron ring symbolizing the ethical commitment their profession undertakes. The ring is proffered in a ceremony called the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, in which an oath penned by Rudyard Kipling is recited. It reads, in part, âMy Time I will not refuse; my Thought I will not grudge; my Care I will not deny toward the honour, use, stability and perfection of any works to which I may be called to set my hand.â (The U.S. Order of the Engineer offers a similar but less poetic rendition of the oath and the ring.) (newline) A persistent legend holds that the rings are forged from steel reclaimed from the Quebec Bridge, which collapsed catastrophically upon construction in 1907, killing dozens of workers. Though false, the myth still holds up allegorically. Even if it doesnât embody it, the Iron Ringâs steel represents the Quebec Bridge, and every other. Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise as designers and builders of bridges or buildingsâor softwareâemanates from that responsibility. Only after answering this calling does an engineer build anything, whether bridges or buildings or software.

(newline) Simple Thread (newline) Primary Menu (newline) Close (newline) Work (newline) Process (newline) Services (newline) Our Story (newline) Blog (newline) Contact Us (newline) software development, thoughts 20 Things I’ve Learned in my 20 Years as a Software Engineer (newline) Justin Etheredge (newline) / (newline) @JustinEtheredge (newline) / October 7, 2021October 14, 2021 (newline) Twitter (newline) Follow us on Twitter (newline) Worried youâll miss us? (newline) Subscribe to get our articles and updates in your inbox. (newline) Email Address (newline) Important, Read This First Youâre about to read a blog post with a lotÂ of advice. Learning from those who came before us is instrumental to success, but we often forget an important caveat. Almost all advice is contextual, yet it is rarely delivered with any context. (newline) âYou just need to charge more!â says the company who has been in business for 20 years and spent years charging âtoo littleâ to gain customers and become successful. (newline) âYou need to build everything as microservices!â says the company who built a quick monolith, gained thousands of customers, and then pivoted into microservices as they started running into scaling issues. (newline) Without understanding the context, the advice is meaningless, or even worse, harmful. If those folks had followed their own advice early on, they themselves would likely have suffered from it. It is hard to escape this trap. We may be the culmination of our experiences, but we view them through the lens of the present. (newline) So to give you a little context on where my advice comes from, I spent the first half of my career as a software engineer working for various small businesses and startups, then I went into consulting and worked in a number of really large businesses. Then I started Simple Thread and we grew from a team of 2 to a team of 25. 10 years ago we worked with mostly small/medium businesses, and now we work with a mix of big and small businesses. (newline) My advice is from someone whoâ¦ has almost always been on small, lean teams where we have to do a lot with very little.values working software over specific tools.is starting new projects all the time, but also has to maintain a number of systems.values engineer productivity over most other considerations My experiences over the last 20 years have shaped how I view software, and have led me to some beliefs which Iâve tried to whittle down to a manageable list that I hope you find valuable. On with the list1. I still donât know very much âHow can you not know what BGP is?â âYouâve never heard of Rust?â Most of us have heard these kinds of statements, probably too often. The reason many of us love software is because we are lifelong learners, and in software no matter which direction you look, there are wide vistas of knowledge going off in every direction and expanding by the day. This means that you can spend decades in your career, and still have a huge knowledge gap compared to someone who has also spent decades in a seemingly similar role. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can start to shed your imposter syndrome and instead delight in learning from and teaching others. 2. The hardest part of software is building the right thing I know this is cliche at this point, but the reason most software engineers donât believe it is because they think it devalues their work. Personally I think that is nonsense. Instead it highlights the complexity and irrationality of the environments in which we have to work, which compounds our challenges. You can design the most technically impressive thing in the world, and then have nobody want to use it. Happens all the time. Designing software is mostly a listening activity, and we often have to be part software engineer, part psychic, and part anthropologist. Investing in this design process, whether through dedicated UX team members or by simply educating yourself, will deliver enormous dividends. Because how do you really calculate the cost of building the wrong software? It amounts to a lot more than just lost engineering time. 3. The best software engineers think like designers Great software engineers think deeply about the user experience of their code. They might not think about it in those terms, but whether it is an external API, programmatic API, user interface, protocol, or any other interface; great engineers consider who will be using it, why it will be used, how it will be used, and what is important to those users. Keeping the userâs needs in mind is really the heart of good user experience. 4. The best code is no code, or code you donât have to maintain All I have to say is âcoders gonna code.â You ask someone in any profession how to solve a problem, and they are going to err on the side of what they are good at. It is just human nature. Most software engineers are always going to err on the side of writing code, especially when a non-technical solution isnât obvious. The same goes for code you donât have to maintain. Engineering teams are apt to want to reinvent the wheel, when lots of wheels already exist. This is a balancing act, there are lots of reasons to grow your own, but beware of toxic âNot Invented Hereâ syndrome. 5. Software is a means to an end The primary job of any software engineer is delivering value. Very few software developers understand this, even fewer internalize it. Truly internalizing this leads to a different way of solving problems, and a different way of viewing your tools. If you really believe that software is subservient to the outcome, youâll be ready to really find âthe right tool for the jobâ which might not be software at all. 6. Sometimes you have to stop sharpening the saw, and just start cutting shit Some people tend to jump into problems and just start writing code. Other people tend to want to research and research and get caught in analysis paralysis. In those cases, set a deadline for yourself and just start exploring solutions. Youâll quickly learn more as you start solving the problem, and that will lead you to iterate into a better solution. 7. If you donât have a good grasp of the universe of whatâs possible, you canât design a good system This is something I struggle with a lot as my responsibilities take me further and further from the day to day of software engineering. Keeping up with the developer ecosystem is a huge amount of work, but it is critical to understand what is possible. If you donât understand what is possible and what is available in a given ecosystem then youâll find it impossible to design a reasonable solution to all but the most simple of problems. To summarize, be wary of people designing systems who havenât written any code in a long time. 8. Every system eventually sucks, get over it Bjarne Stroustrup has a quote that goes âThere are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody usesâ. This can be extended to large systems as well. There is no ârightâ architecture, youâll never pay down all of your technical debt, youâll never design the perfect interface, your tests will always be too slow. This isnât an excuse to never make things better, but instead a way to give you perspective. Worry less about elegance and perfection; instead strive for continuous improvement and creating a livable system that your team enjoys working in and sustainably delivers value. 9. Nobody asks âwhyâ enough Take any opportunity to question assumptions and approaches that are âthe way things have always been doneâ. Have a new team member coming on board? Pay attention to where they get confused and what questions they ask. Have a new feature request that doesn’t make sense? Make sure you understand the goal and what is driving the desire for this functionality.Â If you donât get a clear answer, keep asking why until you understand. 10. We should be far more focused on avoiding 0.1x programmers than finding 10x programmers The 10x programmer is a silly myth. The idea that someone can produce in 1 day what another competent, hard working, similarly experienced programmer can produce in 2 weeks is silly. Iâve seen programmers that sling 10x the amount of code, and then you have to fix it 10x the amount of times. The only way someone can be a 10x programmer is if you compare them to 0.1x programmers. Someone who wastes time, doesn’t ask for feedback, doesn’t test their code, doesn’t consider edge cases, etcâ¦ We should be far more concerned with keeping 0.1x programmers off our teams than finding the mythical 10x programmer. 11. One of the biggest differences between a senior engineer and a junior engineer is that theyâve formed opinions about the way things should be Nothing worries me more than a senior engineer that has no opinion of their tools or how to approach building software. Iâd rather someone give me opinions that I violently disagree with than for them to have no opinions at all. If you are using your tools, and you donât love or hate them in a myriad of ways, you need to experience more. You need to explore other languages, libraries, and paradigms. There are few ways of leveling up your skills faster than actively seeking out how others accomplish tasks with different tools and techniques than you do. 12. People donât really want innovation People talk about innovation a whole lot, but what they are usually looking for is cheap wins and novelty. If you truly innovate, and change the way that people have to do things, expect mostly negative feedback. If you believe in what youâre doing, and know it will really improve things, then brace yourself for a long battle. 13. Your data is the most important part of your system Iâve seen a lot of systems where hope was the primary mechanism of data integrity. In systems like this, anything that happens off the golden path creates partial or dirty data. Dealing with this data in the future can become a nightmare. Just remember, your data will likely long outlive your codebase. Spend energy keeping it orderly and clean, itâll pay off well in the long run. 14. Look for technological sharks Old technologies that have stuck around are sharks, not dinosaurs. They solve problems so well that they have survived the rapid changes that occur constantly in the technology world. Donât bet against these technologies, and replace them only if you have a very good reason. These tools won’t be flashy, and they won’t be exciting, but they will get the job done without a lot of sleepless nights. 15. Donât mistake humility for ignorance There are a lot of software engineers out there who wonât express opinions unless asked. Never assume that just because someone isnât throwing their opinions in your face that they donât have anything to add. Sometimes the noisiest people are the ones we want to listen to the least. Talk to the people around you, seek their feedback and advice. Youâll be glad you did. 16. Software engineers should write regularly Software engineers should regularly blog, journal, write documentation and in general do anything that requires them to keep their written communication skills sharp. Writing helps you think about your problems, and helps you communicate those more effectively with your team and your future self. Good written communication is one of the most important skills for any software engineer to master. 17. Keep your processes as lean as possible Everyone wants to be agile these days, but being âagileâ is about building things in small chunks, learning, and then iterating. If someone is trying to shoehorn much more into it than that, then theyâre probably selling something. It isnât to say that people donât need accountability or help to work this way, but how many times have you heard someone from your favorite tech company or large open source project brag about how great their Scrum process is? Stay lean on process until you know you need more. Trust your team and they will deliver. 18. Software engineers, like all humans, need to feel ownership If you divorce someone from the output of their work, they will care less about their work. I see this almost as a tautology. This is the primary reason why cross-functional teams work so well, and why DevOps has become so popular. It isnât all about handoffs and inefficiencies, it is about owning the whole process from start to finish, and being directly responsible for delivering value. Give a group of passionate people complete ownership over designing, building, and delivering a piece of software (or anything really) and amazing things will happen. 19. Interviews are almost worthless for telling how good of a team member someone will be Interviews are far better spent trying to understand who someone is, and how interested they are in a given field of expertise. Trying to suss out how good of a team member they will be is a fruitless endeavor. And believe me, how smart or knowledgable someone is is also not a good indicator that they will be a great team member. No one is going to tell you in an interview that they are going to be unreliable, abusive, pompous, or never show up to meetings on time. People might claim they have âsignalsâ for these thingsâ¦ âif they ask about time off in the first interview then they are never going to be there!â But these are all bullshit. If youâre using signals like these youâre just guessing and turning away good candidates. 20. Always strive to build a smaller system There are a lot of forces that will push you to build the bigger system up-front. Budget allocation, the inability to decide which features should be cut, the desire to deliver the âbest versionâ of a system. All of these things push us very forcefully towards building too much. You should fight this. You learn so much as youâre building a system that you will end up iterating into a much better system than you ever could have designed in the first place.

It is an excellent learning opportunity. Also, if a vendor introduce a bug, we don’t make a workaround on behalf of the vendor. Use appropriate channels and make sure they clean up their issues.

I’m sure you probably realise this as well. Sure Juniors have “opinions”, but they won’t hold up to any amount of interrogation. Most seniors will have reasons, backed by experience. (newline) It’s usually easy to figure out the difference between someone who was told an opinion and someone who formed one. So I still think the authors sentiment holds. (newline) — > If you are using your tools, and you donât love or hate them in a myriad of ways, you need to experience more. (newline) I don’t think the idea is that your current set of tools are the problem. It’s more that you haven’t looked around at all. Now if you love your tools and their productive, by all means. However, I would say it’s accurate that you can’t say whether or not your tools are good or bad if you haven’t tried others and started understanding the pros and cons. So in that sense it can show seniority in the sense that, you have enough experience with multiple tools to form opinions regarding when they are good/bad. (newline) — > Iâd rather someone give me opinions that I violently disagree with than for them to have no opinions at all. (newline) Here I think you’re just taking his hyperbole too literal.

(newline) As from 20y experience as a software engineer myself, I can add one more thing which I have learned. (newline) #21 Love your co-workers, or leave! I’ve found that to be productive and to be able to create fantastic value, I do not function very well (or at all to be more honest) if fellow co-workers / team-members are rude or inpolite. As an introvert (like the best software nerds usually are), I have not (and still do not) have the habit to defend my self or “kick back”, when ever an outrovert claim the ether during an entire lunch or a meeting, or even worse, is trying to be funny and give jokes that to me often are insulting (even it might not was intended to be!). When hiring, the most important qualification in my opinion, is how humble, polite and positive the attitude the candidate is. Bad attitude, negativism is poison! I tend to leave (any company) when I feel there is too much “poison” around, and that has been a successful strategy (at least) for me so far. Bottom line: find and stay in a team where you find love and passion in your co-workers, where you feel the optimism and positivity around you. Never allow people make you or your ideas less worthy. Your ideas or code may be optimized, but if people around you communicate this to you in a way that makes you feel bad, leave! Make sure to surround you with fellow co-workers that point out how great even your worst piece of code is. Good colleges will complement you for how impressive it is, even they don’t understand anything of it! It is probably “messy” for many reasons and you of all know why, and if allowed, know hows to fix it, better than anyone. (newline) Bottom line: Be aware of your social environment, you will only produce and feel happy about it when the environment allow you to do so! If the environment does not allow this, find a better environment that fits you! (newline) Take this from a simple guy that have created software that is valued billions on Nasdaq today!

(newline) Reply (newline) Jim says: (newline) October 23, 2021 at 8:53 pm (newline) As someone who “transitioned to software” shortly after I learned to walk, here’s an observation & suggestion. (newline) So many people learn formulas or recipes and think they know technology. A monkey can see something done and repeat it. A parrot can hear something and repeat it. But they will be lost and frustrated if the parameters are changed slightly, or worse, if they need to combine elements of multiple skills into something new. You can be much more than a parrot or monkey if you choose to engage your human brain. (newline) So I suggest this: learn what you need to know, and then find out what that is built upon, and learn that too. Go as deep as you can. Why does it work? When might it fail? Who knows about it? Answer these questions for yourself. (newline) But don’t just focus on depth. Explore to the edges of your area, and look a little beyond them. What technical areas border your area of interest? What techniques do they have that might be useful in your area? What if you could combine areas? Is someone already doing that? What do you think is wrong with their approach, and can you improve upon it? (newline) You mentioned reading what “seasoned professionals” write. This is a very good way to learn. Take a look at stack overflow, hacker news, and similar sites, and just binge-read the answers or comments from high-scoring people. There are also practice websites like project euler and hackerrank where you can test your skills against others and again learn from those who are further along on their journey. (newline) Best of luck to you. This can be the most fun in the world, if you let it. (newline) Reply (newline) Oakwoody says: (newline) October 8, 2021 at 10:55 am (newline) As a fellow 20 year journeyman developer I can definitely subscribe to these. #11, the difference between a junior developer and a senior developer is that a senior developer has already made all the mistakes a junior developer will make. A corollary to points #2, #5 and #13: Always strive to fully understand the business/problem domain before you write a single line of code. The flipside of #19, when changing jobs, one of the main questions you should ask from a company is to describe their onboarding processes — how much effort they’re willing to expend on training you is a good indication of whether they are hiring someone to make a contribution or a warm body to fill the headcount.

I came to the saying, “Every line of code you write, that doesn’t eliminate more than one line of code, is you building your tech debt”. Its too easy to point to the ‘legacy’ system as ‘bad’ and start building the ‘good’ replacement and end up with 2x the code to maintain. This usually happens when you get to the final 5% of what the legacy system does, and just run out of time. I’ve been at companies where there are more than three systems, the legacy, the first refactor, the attempt at microservices and the team is busy working on the ‘final refactor’.

I can’t count how many times someone with an affliction for “bright, shiny, new” things has wasted the time of the team and often the company while trying to make their favorite new technology of the week solve a problem that would have taken less time and effort to solve with what the team is already using. What these people are often lacking is the ability to really, thoroughly think things through to the end. The other thing that I see far too often is stagnation in learning. As you’ve said, to be in this field requires continual learning and people that refuse to accept that effectively tie themselves to the past and get left behind.

Otherwise you can’t easily bring in new people, nor can experienced people juggle multiple projects at once with minimal context switching.

On your point 7, I’d recommend having a read of a fairly new book called Fundamentals of Software Architecture which has a great chapter about knowledge depth vs. knowledge breadth – in summary, as you get more experience and do more design level type work, you need to increase the breadth of your knowledge – to know what is possible and what is out there. At the same time you’ll find you can’t have a depth of knowledge about everything, otherwise you’ll run yourself ragged. You can still focus on a few different specialist areas or frameworks which you keep up to date with, but you need to supplement this with knowledge breadth – a shallow and wide knowledge about as much as possible.

I see it at my job and I hear about it from friends who also work in IT in varying capacities. In an industry that’s built on change, maximizing efficiency, and finding new ways to do things it astounds me that so many companies refuse to charge the way things get done. (newline) I understand that some upgrades require massive restructuring that doesn’t always make practical or financial sense, but there’s just no excuse for certain things. No one questions why we’re still using this horribly buggy software from 1995, or why we haven’t automated a tedious but very simple manual process, or identified the source of a break in the process flow that confuses both the users and the devs who maintain the software. It’s maddening. (newline) Great points overall.

For example, I have iPad of the first generation, (newline) it is fully functional, however less than 20% sites still work on it. Sure, sites I developed still work great. I can’t say that new software offers something completely different, for example Gmail stopped working on the iPad as six months, although I didn’t notice any new functionality in it. When developer will focus on creation something really new, then just try new technologies for old things?

Couple of things i would add from my 18 years of experience from firmware development to web apps development, and integrating very large and poorly written components and dealing with 100s of engineers on daily basis. (newline) 1- “Write code for others and do not own your code , write it so clean and easy to understand + review is so critically(publicly too) that people takes its ownership so easily without feeling any pressure from you. When you write for others to maintain then you become a developer who writes important parts of the system and pass to other people. 2- And finally a very important thing, “never get scared, software doesn’t bite, trying to write something complicated or something you have no idea about is the safest risk you would ever take in your life, it pays high dividends. The sooner you are fearless the faster you grow” (newline) Reply (newline) Hasan says: (newline) October 11, 2021 at 6:53 am (newline) Thanks for tips (newline) Reply (newline) Moti Mashiah says: (newline) October 11, 2021 at 8:35 am (newline) Great article as a software engineer over 10 years.

(Mostly inside code editor on local machine or on remote machine) – People are adding more and more new services (sometime Heterogeneous service build with different languages/frameworks) and does not think about how difficult it will be to maintain it in future.

I often feel bad about not knowing details about some of the areas too like BGP/Rust etc But that’s the nature of our industry. There’s a huge amount of areas to dig into. (newline) Reply (newline) George Tucker says: (newline) October 15, 2021 at 12:21 pm (newline) Always understand the business goals youâre setting out to achieve. (newline) When Iâm outlining a project, in a briefing or a requirements doc, I always start with the goal: âWe need to email customers real-time tracking updates from USPS and UPS.â Or, âWe want to find out which products are most frequently sold together.â (newline) Making sure the business goal is clear right at the top helps reduce scope creep and dead ends. And if the stakeholders canât agree on the business goal, well, you canât even get started. (newline) Another thought: thereâs this gem from the Terry Pratchett novel Making Money, about the Igors (race of steampunk surgical/technological inventor geniuses), paraphrasing: âIgors didnât build what you asked for. They built what you wanted.â (newline) If youâre clear on the goals, you can build whatâs wanted regardless of whatâs asked for. (newline) Reply (newline) Bill says: (newline) October 19, 2021 at 7:18 pm (newline) It’s hard to choose just one point, they’re all good. I’d roll with 2, 4 and 18. (newline) #2: I just had a conversation with someone; the company built an incredible (and expensive) software product that then produced almost zero income. Why? As ingenuitive as the product was, decision makers had no need for it. Asking a client questions about what they want, we really do have to read between the lines to give them what they need. And I’ll second what George Tucker said about Igors – that was funny. (newline) #4: Tech debt is a major topic – part of reducing it is avoiding it. I’ve seen some companies rewrite a product rather than maintain it. One lesson learned – figure out your assumptions and then question their validity. (newline) #18: I had to laugh when I saw tautology. I thought the first sentence worked both grammatically (though debatable) and mathematically (definitely). (newline) Reply (newline) Chris Bartley says: (newline) October 23, 2021 at 3:28 pm (newline) Just wanted to say thanks and give a big thumbs up. And extra thanks for the time it must have taken to put it together…that dedication to caring and trying to make the path easier for others speaks volumes. (newline) I’m in the 25+ years experience camp, and found zero points of disagreement. There’s a ton of wisdom here–hard earned, I’m sure–and it’s something I wish had been required reading when I started. Very well done.

It makes it easier to digest. (newline) Point number 6 stood out to me. Because of my lack of experience, I tend to overthink things which extends project deadlines, sometimes by a huge factor. Iâve been learning to just âcut shitâ even if it feels like Iâm making âmud piesâ with my code. It sometimes helps just to get something working, and then think about how to improve it after. In most cases I end up iterating on the concept and producing something really great, which could only have happened by just starting.

I pretty much like the designer approach and call for simplicity. Team culture also is a big factor to success. Responsibility is another. (newline) One I missed, to me always helpful was/is “limit features in favor for stability and maintainability”. (newline) Users don’t miss and cannot complain on features that are not existing. However, features that are out there available to the users must be solid, really solid. In addition, any features not existing don’t need to be maintained. This means cost savings on upgrades, customer support and time savings for focussing on the essentials. (newline) In context, from an inner programmers view this means, less external libraries included can be more. Which is not meant to reinvent the wheel. (newline) Maybe there is another one. Standards are great, a working solution is even greater.

These are the topics, that when properly addressed, make solid software. (newline) In my view, there’s one big old problem: financiers. They pay. You do as they say. The people in finance will always destroy at least half of the goals in the above list, every. Single. Time. (newline) So I quit programming. Why? Because I like doing the old-fashioned, blue-collar type job; whether I’m sweeping up saw dust or writing CAD software for UAV designers.

Learn Software Engineering Levels to Advance Your Career (newline) Interview Courses (newline) Interview Coaching (newline) Blog (newline) Company Guides (newline) Learn Software Engineering Levels to Advance Your Career and Climb the Ladder (newline) Last updated on (newline) Sep 29, 2022 (newline) Hey there! This article is part of our series on Software Engineering. For even more help and resources, check out our complete (newline) Software Engineering Interview Course . Software engineering levels are the road map that gets you to your career destination and higher up the software engineering ladder. Understanding how they work is fundamental to navigating the software engineer career path. (newline) Of course, itâs not all just for you! Levels also help employers in the hiring and promotion process. (newline) Software engineering levels create a clear ladder of progression. Understanding the responsibilities and expectations for each level will help you to climb that ladder. (newline) What you can expect from this article is a look at a standard level system. We'll break down the value of levels and then a zoom in on how levels work at different tech companies. (newline) By the end, youâll have the information and tools you need to see how you need to get where you want to be as a software engineer. Standard Software Engineer Career LevelsSource: (newline) Edvard Alexander RÃ¸lvaag (newline) on Unsplash.com The standard software engineering career levels are as follows: Level 1 - Software EngineerLevel 2 - Senior EngineerLevel 3 - Staff Engineer (alternate: Senior Staff Â  Â  Â Engineer)Level 4 - Principal EngineerLevel 5 - Distinguished Engineer / Fellow Individual companies often use personalized leveling systems that contain more tiers, but they generally follow this basic outline. (newline) Keeping in mind that this is a generalized list, letâs look at whatâs expected for each level. Level 1 - Software Engineer This position, sometimes called a Junior Software Engineer, is usually someoneâs first full-time software engineering job. (newline) Engineers at this level are not expected to take much ownership over the companyâs product. (newline) Instead, they work on assignments given to them by people who have decided on the direction of the product. (newline) The general order of operations looks like this: (newline) The highest level engineers find problems and focus teams on those problems. Mid-level engineers take those problems and find solutions. Mid-level software engineers then explain the solution to junior engineers. And junior engineers work on coding (newline) one piece of that solution. (newline) Engineers at this level are expected to be competent, but not experts. (newline) The company knows that thereâs going to be a learning process, and they know youâll even mess up sometimes. Thatâs fine. (newline) They want someone who is a quick learner, a creative thinker, and can work well on a team. (newline) Entry-level Software Engineer Compensation (newline) Of course, compensation packages have a wide range depending on who youâre working for and where youâre working! (newline) The average software engineer in San Francisco earns about $115,000 per year. (newline) Software engineers at the top tech companies like Google can earn about $187,000 per year considering the total compensation package. (newline) Advancing Your Career to Senior Engineer (newline) On top of experience, getting to the next level will require proven competence across a wide range of tools and types of problems. (newline) Basically, the ability to ride the bike after taking off the junior software engineer training wheels. (newline) To get there, learn and practice as much as you can. (newline) Learn about new programs. Learn about solving problems youâre unfamiliar with. (newline) Keep notes on things youâve had to ask for help with. Practice those issues so you can do it independently next time. (newline) Donât shy away from asking for helpâmentoring is one of the best ways to learn. (newline) But youâll want to eventually show that you can work well with minimal supervision in order to get to the next level. Level 2 - Senior Software Engineer Senior software engineers typically boast 3 or more years of full-time engineering experience. t doesnât necessarily have to be at the same company. (newline) While the scope of this position is not significantly larger than that of a junior engineer, the position carries higher expectations. (newline) Itâs not a manager position. A senior engineer will still be working on solutions given to them by their engineering manager or a product director. (newline) But management will expect that a senior engineer can complete the solution with little or no guidance. (newline) Senior software engineers are also expected to have at least some kind of role in guiding the junior engineers. (newline) Senior engineers are knowledgeable people on the team. Itâs expected that they can help get junior engineers up to speed. (newline) Senior Software Engineer Compensation (newline) Senior software engineers earn an average salary of Â $134,386 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Top tech companies pay around $194,372 for top talent. Equity and stock options are often an important part of your total compensation, and itâs important to have a plan in place to exercise them when you leave your job. Check out Equitybee to fund your exercise cost, so you donât lose out on them! (newline) Advancing to Staff Engineer (newline) On top of experience and technical skills, the next level requires people skills. As a staff engineer, youâre either moving towards management or becoming an independent contributor. (newline) Both require excellent communication skills. (newline) This doesnât require you to go over the top with forced small talk at every available moment. In fact, doing so is more likely to annoy coworkers than to endear them! (newline) Take a genuine interest in the people around you. Remember that success at a job requires honing your skills, but it also requires supporting your team. (newline) Additionally, getting to the next level requires an understanding of the big picture. (newline) Learn how systems come together when developing an app. What's are the company's 5 and 10-year goals? Level 3 - Staff Engineer The Role: With the staff engineer, we are officially into management territory. This position is often 6 or more years into your career, and now it starts to become a benefit if those years are at the company. (newline) We mentioned before that junior engineers arenât deciding on the problems nor are they coming up with the solutions, but instead they are given solutions to work on by managers. A staff engineer is likely that manager giving the solution. A staff engineer will often act as a go-between for the higher management who are making the company-wide decisions and the engineers who are writing the actual code. (newline) A staff engineer will sometimes help decide on a problem to focus on and sometimes a staff engineer will spend time writing in code, but the primary role of a staff engineer is to ensure the team produces a strong solution for the problem upper management wants to focus on. (newline) $$$: Average salary of $140,492 per year in the Bay Area. At the top tech companies, it can be around $210,966 per year. Â (newline) The Next Level: The next level is tough, and most will not reach it. On top of people skills and coding skills and all the other skills mentioned, advancing to the next level requires a long track record of ownership over projects that are more than just successful. It requires innovation. For the next level, theyâll be looking for people who can do more than correctly use the systems. They want people that can change the systems. (newline) Level 4 - Principal Engineer The vast majority of engineers will not progress to this level. These positions are rare, requiring a long track record of proven success as well as a good deal strategyâor luckâwith being in the right place at the right time. (newline) The higher one goes into management, the more difficult it is to say that this position will come after X years, especially when different companies are using different level systems. However, this position is usually 10 or so years down the line. (newline) While the staff engineer ensures success on their team, the principal engineer begins to transcend teams. The focus is now on the company as a whole. And rather than finding solutions to problems, the principal engineer is now working on finding what those problems are in the first place. (newline) This is a significant shift in scope of oneâs work. This position is far less about coding, and far more about business and theoretical ideas. (newline) This is part of the reason why itâs so important to understand software engineering levels for the company youâre at. If managing teams and deciding the direction of the company sounds exciting to you, then chase this ladder. However, if that doesnât sound interesting and youâd rather develop into an all-star coder, then you should look into ladders that lead to being an individual contributor. (newline) $$$: Salaries become far more difficult to predict at this range. Glassdoor places the average salary at $148,633 per year, but that can go up to $907,500 a year at the big tech companies, with a total compensation package of well over a million dollars. (newline) The Next Level: Exceptionally few get to the next level. The next level is reserved for those who shape the entire industry. Level 5 - Distinguished Engineer / Fellow This is essentially the top of the totem pole. These are computer science gurus who have imagined, built, launched, and maintained multiple massively successful projects. Their influence trickles down throughout the entire company. If the company is influential enough, that influence likely extends throughout the entire industry. (newline) For example, Sebastian Thrun is someone who has held the honor of being a Google Fellow. He co-developed Google Street View. (newline) $$$: The sky's the limit. The Value of LevelsSource: (newline) Sam Mgrdichian (newline) on Unsplash.com Overall, levels help both you and the employer because they create clear expectations, thus avoiding misunderstandings. To set the stage, letâs first discuss why companies use levels. Then weâll look at how you can make the level system work for you. (newline) For Companies Although this article will focus on software engineering levels, the concept of a multi-tiered leveling system is not unique to software engineering positions. Lots of fields and companies use levels to add structure to their workforce. (newline) The main way that levels benefit a company is that it helps to avoid conflict. In an article on Noteworthy - The Journal Blog, Chuck Groom describes several awkward situations that a company can avoid by using a well-structured level system. (newline) One situations states: Frank wants a promotion to a âSeniorâ title, but we donât feel heâs ready yet; he asks why not? â We need a way to explain the difference between levels, and give Frank guidance on which skills to develop. Another hypothetical situation he gives is: We hired Karen a few years ago at $85k/year. We hired Noreen this summer â after a bidding war with Facebook, her salary wound up being $120k/year. Karen and Noreen do the same work. Over drinks, Karen finds out how much Noreen is paid. â This is a disaster. We canât afford to pay everyone $120k. But Karen has every right to call foul. These are nightmare scenarios for any manager or HR department. It leads to conflict, and conflict leads to a disgruntled team. Things start to fall apart all because the company had no satisfying answer to give for why this employee wasnât ready for a promotion or why that employee earns less than a coworker. Using levels gives companies that satisfying answer. (newline) On the flip side, a company might be able to get by with paying some employees less if they didnât use a structured level system. However, the level system helps companies to avoid a world of headache. (newline) Itâs like the difference between haggling over the price of an apple at a farmerâs market versus buying it for the listed price at Target. I might save a few cents by haggling, but Iâd rather not debate the price of produce every time I want an apple. For You Employers use levels because it helps them, but it also helps you as an employee. The main reason is that it provides clarity to your career path. (newline) Suppose youâre in the position of Frank, engineer from the scenario a few paragraphs prior. Heâs an engineer looking for a promotion, but he works at a level-less company. His promotion is denied and heâs left without knowing what he could do better to ensure the promotion next time. Was his work not good enough? Did he not have enough years of experience? Do the managers only give promotions to their personal friends? (newline) Levels do away with all that mess. They clearly state that to get a certain position, youâll need X number of years and Y set of skill equals. Therefore, you know exactly where to direct your energy in order to improve your career. There will still be some level of discretion from managers, but levels generally make promotions far more straightforward. (newline) Likewise, levels can make the process simpler if youâre applying to a company that you know uses levels. Gone are all those worries over which position to apply for, constantly wondering if youâre selling yourself too short or overselling yourself. Levels show clear expectations so that you know exactly for which position you should apply. (newline) SoundCloud has a great write up on their level system. In a brief section explaining why they use a level system, they say: To provide clarity on what our understanding of growth is, we have a level system (as many other companies do). This system defines our engineering culture by giving guidance to people on how to increase their impact within SoundCloud, facilitating career discussions between engineers and their managers, providing a framework for setting salaries, and last but not least, encouraging and rewarding certain behaviors.Transparency around everyoneâs level at a company helps people identify their role models. Additionally, an explicit level structure is beneficial for people who are underrepresented, as non-explicit hierarchies tend to favor the people who form the majority (which, most of the time, is white men).Level Variety A good exercise is to spend some time on Levels.fyi comparing companies to each other. Look at the structure of their level system, and also click on the first few levels to get a general idea for that levelâs compensation and how many years of experience it requires. (newline) What youâll often see is that while using levels provides structure, it still has flexibility. It becomes even more flexible the higher up the ladder one goes. The more control over the company a position has, the more inclined a company is to take a personal approach instead of following an assembly line promotion process. (newline) Googleâs level system is certainly the most influential throughout the industry. Many smaller tech companies and departments use a similar system. Still, variety exists. One can see this just by looking at five of the biggest tech companies. Source: Levels.fyi A quick glance gives you a rough idea of what progressing through the company would feel like. Google, Facebook, and Amazon all use similar tracks. They donât have notable variation, and what variation exists is generally towards the higher end of the ladder. (newline) The two outliers are Apple and Microsoft. Microsoft has roughly double the number of levels as the other major companies. A career with Microsoft would likely mean that each promotion is smaller, but those promotions come much more often. Apple has significantly fewer levels than the other companies, so the opposite would be true. (newline) Variety can go even further than that. In the image below, one of these is not like the others: Source: Levels.fyi Netflix chooses to operate without a level system. All of their software engineers are senior software engineers. (newline) The lack of levels seems appropriate for a company like Netflix. They arenât developing a hundred different projects like other tech giants. Instead, they have their streaming platform, and all they want is to work on that one project. (newline) Additionally, Netflix famously has a culture which values merit over hierarchy. Every engineer is a senior engineer because they seem to only hire engineers with years of experience. They expect their people to work hard and speak their mind. The push employees, but also compensate. Their pay leans much more towards base salary than company stock, but the overall package is often higher than it is for similar years of experience with other companies. (newline) In Short Companies use levels because it provides structure, and you can use that structure to make your climb easier. Every company will have a leveling system thatâs slightly different, but the basic idea will remain the same. Learn the levels, learn whatâs expected for the next level, and then direct your energy in that direction. This is the best strategy to advance your career. (newline) And if youâre just starting your career, Exponentâs system design interview course provides the jump start you need to succeed.

Managing Software Engineers (newline) Managing Software Engineers (newline) by Philip Greenspun in October 2002 (newline) Site Home : Ancient History : One artifact (newline) Editor's Note: This article refers to a company, ArsDigita, that (newline) developed an open-source software product, a toolkit for building (newline) Internet applications. (newline) This toolkit was reasonably popular between 1998 (newline) and early 2001. (newline) Please note that this article is part of an archive. (newline) Do not expect the links to work. (newline) The Original Text of the Article: (newline) Philip Greenspun founded ArsDigita Corporation and was its CEO from (newline) inception until it reached $20 million/year in revenue. (newline) Currently he (newline) flies airplanes and helicopters and teaches electrical engineering and (newline) computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (newline) Why an article on managing people? (newline) And one written by someone with (newline) training in computer science rather than business administration? (newline) There are thousands of books on the best ways to manage people. (newline) Many (newline) of these books are excellent, having been written by people who've (newline) devoted their lives to the discipline. (newline) Software engineering is different. (newline) Software engineering is different because only the best people (newline) significantly contribute to achievement. (newline) Traditional management texts (newline) assume a distribution of talent among the workers. (newline) Each worker is (newline) contributing something useful and the challenge is to get each one to (newline) perform at his or her maximum potential. (newline) In the same factory, the (newline) best worker may produce two or three times as much as the average, but (newline) all the workers are contributing. (newline) In software engineering a good (newline) programmer is at least 10 times more productive than an average (newline) programmer (Brooks 1995). (newline) If a product is being developed rapidly, the average (newline) programmers will consume nearly their entire work day just in reading (newline) and understanding the new code generated by the good programmers. (newline) Thus the challenges of a software engineering manager first and (newline) foremost are (1) creating a work environment where good programmers (newline) will be satisfied enough to stay, and (2) creating a system via which (newline) average programmers can become good. (newline) In an ideal software engineering (newline) organization, there are still some average-quality people but these (newline) should be viewed as being apprenticed to the best people and being (newline) taught as fast as possible. (newline) Software engineering is different because people at all levels of the (newline) organization perceive themselves to be equally intelligent. (newline) Consensus-style management can perhaps work when there is a gradient (newline) of perceived ability. (newline) Given enough time, the less able workers will (newline) follow the lead of the more able workers. (newline) One of the paradoxes of (newline) software engineering is that people with bad ideas and low (newline) productivity often think of themselves as supremely capable. (newline) They are (newline) the last people whom one can expect to fall in line with a good (newline) strategy developed by someone else. (newline) As for the good programmers who (newline) are in fact supremely capable, there is no reason to expect consensus (newline) to form among them. (newline) Each programmer thinks his or her idea about what (newline) to build and how to build it is the best. (newline) (See Kruger and Dunning's (newline) "Unskilled (newline) and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own (newline) Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments" for more on this (newline) topic.) (newline) Software engineering is different because a leaf-node worker is more (newline) expert than any manager, even when the manager is a great engineer, in (newline) at least the small portion of the system that the leaf-node worker has (newline) personally built. (newline) This makes it difficult for a manager to engage in (newline) a technical argument with a worker. (newline) It becomes nearly impossible when (newline) the manager's technical skills are weak. (newline) The worker can spin castles (newline) of complexity in the air and come up with impressive-to-the-MBA (newline) excuses for why it has to be done a certain way or on a certain (newline) schedule. (newline) Software engineering is different because the organization can't (newline) afford to lose the individual productivity of the best people by (newline) pushing them into management. (newline) A truly great programmer may generate (newline) 10 times as much business value as a merely good programmer. (newline) Can the (newline) organization afford to take someone who can do the work of 100 average (newline) programmers and push him or her into a pure management role? (newline) Probably (newline) not. (newline) Can the organization afford to put people with weak technical (newline) skills into management roles? (newline) Probably not. (newline) Once you give Joe MBA a (newline) title and ask him to coordinate eventually he will be making decisions (newline) that have engineering implications. (newline) Thus many of the best programmers (newline) are eventually forced at least to assume project leadership and (newline) mentoring responsibilites. (newline) Since they are still expected to produce (newline) designs, software, documentation, and journal articles, the danger is (newline) that the new manager will become glued to his or her screen and never (newline) look up to see how the project team is doing. (newline) Software engineering is different because measurement is notoriously (newline) difficult. (newline) The world is full of products that failed due to overly (newline) complex and tasteless designs. (newline) Yet all of these designs were (newline) considered tasteful by their architects. (newline) Systems that experts (newline) evaluated and found wanting, such as the Unix operating system (1970), (newline) eventually proved to have great utility. (newline) It is a bit easier to count (newline) up the lines of code per day produced by a programmer but if the (newline) project was not very tightly specified originally, how do you know (newline) whether or not these lines of code are useful? (newline) At this point a skeptical reader might be thinking that, while (newline) software engineering is different from line production work or any (newline) other endeavor with a manufacturing division of labor, there are (newline) similarities with research and development, management consulting, and (newline) financial analysis. (newline) This is certainly true but there aren't too many (newline) interesting books on how to reliably produce results in these fields (newline) (one is referenced in the "More" section below). (newline) Ideas to Steal (newline) Software engineering is different but it is not that (newline) different. (newline) What ideas can we steal from the broader world? (newline) people don't do what they are told (newline) all performers get the right consequences every day (newline) small, immediate, certain consequences are better than large (newline) future uncertain ones (newline) positive reinforcement is more effective than negative (newline) reinforcement (newline) ownership leads to high productivity (newline) people don't do what they are told (newline) In Bringing out the Best in People, Aubrey Daniels notes (newline) "If we always did what we were told, we would eat only nutritious (newline) foods, never drink too much alcohol, and exercise regularly." (newline) There (newline) is thus a natural limit on the effectiveness of written policies and (newline) management by telling then nagging. (newline) A corollary to this principle is that people do what you reward them (newline) to do, not what you hope they will do. (newline) Often, when you look at what (newline) is truly rewarded in an organization, you find it is different than (newline) what you think is rewarded. (newline) Do the managers have an engineering (newline) background? (newline) If not, they'll probably be unable to perceive when a (newline) programmer is accomplishing nothing. (newline) So the programmer who does (newline) nothing gets a paycheck at the end of the month. (newline) Having thus been (newline) rewarded for doing nothing, the programmer tries it again the next (newline) month... (newline) all performers get the right consequences every day (newline) The natural way to manage is to spend time with people who aren't (newline) doing a good job. (newline) You help them out. (newline) You remind them of the good (newline) things that can happen to them if they finish a project or raise the (newline) spectre of their being laid off the next time the company needs to (newline) improve its profitability. (newline) These are probably the right consequences (newline) for someone who is underperforming. (newline) But what about the people who (newline) are performing? (newline) What if you ignore them day-to-day? (newline) Unless (newline) they are getting positive reinforcement from another source, they may (newline) stop coming in on the weekends to get a release out the door earlier, (newline) stop documenting their code, stop writing journal articles. (newline) A top (newline) performer won't sink to the level of a problem employee but that (newline) person may become average. (newline) And in the long run a company with average (newline) workers will at best earn an average return on equity. (newline) small, immediate, certain consequences are better than large, (newline) future, uncertain ones (newline) An annual review and bonus is not classically considered a very good (newline) way to motivate people. (newline) It is too far away, especially in a dotcom (newline) economy. (newline) Even if a worker is able to keep the bonus goal fixed in his (newline) or her head for the 365 days preceding the bonus allocation, there is (newline) uncertainty attached to it. (newline) What if the company is doing really badly (newline) at the end of the year? (newline) Will there still be a bonus? (newline) positive reinforcement is more effective than negative (newline) reinforcement (newline) Like most schools worldwide, MIT practices negative reinforcement at (newline) the undergraduate level. (newline) If student does not do a problem set by a (newline) certain deadline, we give him or her a bad grade. (newline) This has turned out (newline) to be extremely effective at ensuring that an MIT graduate has (newline) achieved some minimum standard. (newline) However, the students don't (newline) accomplish all that they could. (newline) The first term that we taught 6.916, (newline) we gave the students one week to do Problem Set 1. (newline) It was pretty (newline) tough and some of them worked all night the last two nights. (newline) Having (newline) watched them still at their terminals when we left the lab at 4:00 am, (newline) we wanted to be kinder and gentler the next semester. (newline) So we gave them (newline) two weeks to do the same homework assignment. (newline) The first week went (newline) by. (newline) The students were working on other classes, playing sports on the (newline) lawn, going out with friends. (newline) They didn't start working on the (newline) problem set until a few days before it was due and ended up in the lab (newline) all night just as before. (newline) We thus proved the management adage that a deadline just gives someone (newline) an excuse to procrastinate and do nothing until the very end. (newline) Graduate school at MIT is different. (newline) We want the students to do (newline) research, write up their results, publish them in journals, and (newline) graduate with a reasonably interesting PhD thesis. (newline) If a student (newline) finishes some research, the most effective faculty advisors (newline) immediately provide positive reinforcement by paying attention, (newline) helping design the next experiment, helping to draft a paper outline. (newline) If the student finishes a write-up, he or she is positively reinforced (newline) by being sent to a conference to present it. (newline) If the student finishes (newline) a PhD thesis, he or she is positively reinforced by being given a 3-7X (newline) pay raise. (newline) The lesson from MIT? (newline) Negative reinforcement can work if the (newline) organization is extremely tightly managed, if the consequences are (newline) small and immediate (usually a problem set is due every week and only (newline) represents a part of the final grade), and if the goal is to make sure (newline) that everyone comes up to a reasonable level. (newline) However, the (newline) worldwide fame of MIT rests on research achievements by graduate (newline) students. (newline) This innovation is mostly supported by positive (newline) reinforcement. (newline) ownership leads to high productivity (newline) A related issue to positive/negative reinforcement is (newline) ownership. (newline) Non-ownership systems discipline those who are not (newline) working up to the minimum standard, but they do not offer enough of an (newline) upside to truly motivate people. (newline) Morever, non-ownership systems (newline) demand a very accurate setting of standards. (newline) Ownership-oriented (newline) systems include contingent rewards with an almost unlimited upside, (newline) and are thus effective at getting as much discretionary effort out of (newline) workers as possible. (newline) As an example, in the early days of ArsDigita we had only a handful of (newline) customers: America Online, Environmental Defense Fund, (newline) Hewlett-Packard, Levi Strauss, Oracle Corporation, and Siemens. (newline) We (newline) had only a handful of programmers as well and hence the easiest way to (newline) divide the work was to give a programmer total responsibility for one (newline) project. (newline) The programmer owned that customer. (newline) If the project (newline) went well and the customer wrote us a big check, we gave nearly all of (newline) the money directly to the programmer. (newline) If any project had gone poorly (newline) and we'd been fired by a customer, we would not have had to think very (newline) hard to figure out who was responsible (fortunately this never (newline) happened while I was running the company!). (newline) People worked insanely (newline) hard to make their projects successful and their clients happy. (newline) More (newline) importantly, the programmer who did an entire project by him or (newline) herself learned enough to train new people, lead a larger project, (newline) etc. (newline) After we grew beyond the 40-person mark, pressures to dilute the (newline) ownership aspects of our organization grew. (newline) We wanted to grow (newline) rapidly--nobody wants to buy enterprise software from a small company, (newline) even if the software happens to be open source. (newline) As our reputation (newline) grew, customers came to us with larger projects. (newline) We believed that (newline) many of our developers were too junior to handle complete (newline) responsibility for these large projects. (newline) Our costs went up because we (newline) had to coordinate the diffused responsibility. (newline) In the summer of 2000, (newline) when we had 200 or so employees, one of our clients was unhappy. It (newline) took a week just to arrange a meeting among the five managers who bore (newline) collective responsibility for the project! (newline) Meanwhile, individual (newline) productivity fell. (newline) It was taking more programmer-months and more (newline) calendar months to get things done. (newline) On weekend mornings you could (newline) walk naked through an entire floor of our headquarters building (newline) without fear of embarrassment. (newline) (At the time of this writing, there is a proposal on the table to (newline) consolidate some of the separate management pyramids, thus taking us (newline) back closer to our original structure.) (newline) Building and keeping a good software engineering team (newline) What is the best way to attract some good software engineers to your (newline) organization? (newline) Hire a few to begin with. (newline) Good people like to work (newline) with other good people. (newline) This is true in every field but much more (newline) acute in software engineering. (newline) Why? (newline) Consider two management (newline) consultants working on different projects but within the same (newline) organization. (newline) If Consultant A does a bad job it harms Consultant B's (newline) reputation to some extent but does not require Consultant B to take (newline) any action. (newline) Whereas in most tech companies if Programmer A does a bad (newline) job it usually means that Programmer B will eventually be forced to (newline) use the bad code, read the bad code, and then fix the bad code. (newline) What attracts good programmers? (newline) Traditionally the best programmers (newline) seek the most challenging problems. (newline) They want to work in an (newline) organization that is trying to build something important. (newline) Programmers (newline) have huge and fragile egos. (newline) If they are somehow assigned to a trivial (newline) problem and that is their only possible task, they may spend six (newline) months coming up with a bewildering architecture more complex than the (newline) Windows 2000 operating system, merely so that they can show their (newline) friends and colleagues what a tough nut they are trying to crack. (newline) Another source of ego-gratification for programmers is to have other (newline) programmers admiring their work. (newline) Open-source software projects thus (newline) have a big recruiting advantage over closed-source software (newline) companies. (newline) What kind of working environment is necessary for programmer (newline) satisfaction? (newline) Good programmers want to achieve and therefore removing (newline) barriers to achievement is the most important step that one can take (newline) in creating an effective working environment. (newline) Programmers dread (newline) elaborate process, endless meetings, and layers of marketing approval (newline) before a product can be shipped. (newline) Ideally it would be possible to (newline) conceive a product on Friday evening, set up the development (newline) environment Friday night, write code on Saturday and Sunday, test on (newline) Sunday night, and ship on Monday morning. (newline) Maintaining this kind of (newline) freedom is a serious challenge as a company grows and its products (newline) become more complex. (newline) Successful companies such as Oracle Corporation (newline) burden their marketing departments with overlapping products rather (newline) than stifle programmer initiative. (newline) For example, during most of the (newline) late 1990s there were at least three different Web servers that you (newline) could buy from Oracle, each one backed up by a document explaining why (newline) it was the one true path toward database-backed Web site glory. (newline) A good physical working environment is essential. (newline) Great programmers (newline) get a lot of positive reinforcement from their work itself. (newline) They (newline) write some code and immediately can see it dance. (newline) That keeps them at (newline) work for hours that, while they would not impress a taxi driver in (newline) Singapore or a factory worker in Guangzhou, will surprise (newline) many American business people. (newline) When we hired an architect to lay out (newline) the interior of ArsDigita's first building in Cambridge he surveyed (newline) the programmers and came back shaking his head: "I've never seen any (newline) group of people who spend so many hours continuously sitting at their (newline) desks." (newline) From a business point of view, long hours by programmers are a key to (newline) profitability. (newline) Suppose that a programmer needs to spend 25 hours per (newline) week keeping current with new technology, getting coordinated with (newline) other programmers, contributing to documentation and thought (newline) leadership pieces, and comprehending the structures of the systems (newline) being extended. (newline) Under this assumption, a programmer who works 55 (newline) hours per week will produce twice as much code as one who works 40 (newline) hours per week. (newline) In The Mythical Man-Month, the only (newline) great book ever written on software engineering, Fred Brooks concludes (newline) that no software product should be designed by more than two people. (newline) He argues that a program designed by more than two people might be (newline) more complete but it will never be easy to understand because it will (newline) not be as consistent as something designed by fewer people. (newline) This (newline) means that if you want to follow the best practices of the industry in (newline) terms of design and architecture, the only way to improve speed to (newline) market is to have the same people working longer hours. (newline) Finally there (newline) is the common sense notion that the smaller the team the less (newline) management overhead. (newline) A product is going to get out the door much (newline) faster if it is built by 4 people working 70-hour weeks (180 (newline) productive programmer-hours per week, after subtracting for 25 hours (newline) of coordination and structure comprehension time) than if by 12 people (newline) working 40-hour weeks (the same net of 180 hours per week). (newline) The (newline) 12-person team will inevitably require additional managers and all-day (newline) meetings to stay coordinated. (newline) Your business success will depend on the extent to which programmers (newline) essentially live at your office. (newline) For this to be a common choice, your (newline) office had better be nicer than the average programmer's home. (newline) There (newline) are two ways to achieve this result. (newline) One is to hire programmers who (newline) live in extremely shabby apartments. (newline) The other is to create a nice (newline) office. (newline) Microsoft understands this. (newline) In the early 1990s they did (newline) radio spots with John Cleese as a spokesman. (newline) One of the main points (newline) of the ad was to ridicule the cheap open-plan offices in which (newline) programmers were traditionally housed and promote the fact that at (newline) Microsoft each developer gets a plush personal office. (newline) How can an office be nicer than one's home? (newline) Let's consider the (newline) following dimensions: (newline) social (newline) physical comfort (newline) aesthetic (newline) entertainment (newline) attractive (newline) Social (newline) It is easy for an office to beat the home on the social dimension, (newline) especially if the programmer lives alone. (newline) If there are people at work (newline) at all times of day and night and you've succeeded in building an (newline) organization of good people, ipso facto there is always someone (newline) interesting to talk to at the office. (newline) To exploit fully the social (newline) possibilities of the programmers' office, it is important to have (newline) informal gathering spaces. (newline) At the MIT Artificial Intelligence (newline) Laboratory, which has nurtured groups of great programmers for nearly (newline) 40 years, the gathering spaces are referred to as "playrooms". (newline) These (newline) contain sofas and coffee tables, movable in the best tradition of (newline) Dewey, where programmers eat, talk, and occasionally listen to (newline) presentations. (newline) Usually a playroom will have some sort of shared (newline) writing surface such as a whiteboard. (newline) Note that these playrooms also (newline) are an important part of an organization's knowledge management (newline) system. (newline) You need to give programmers from different projects a place (newline) to meet where problems can be discussed and solutions from older/other (newline) projects can be suggested. (newline) A social place will never be friendly if it is trapped behind a high (newline) wall of security. (newline) It ought to be very easy for a programmer to invite (newline) a friend over. (newline) If programmers are comfortable meeting their friends (newline) at the office it greatly increases the likelihood of friends (newline) recruiting friends. (newline) An open office plan contributes to making the work environment (newline) stronger on the social dimension. (newline) Physical Comfort (newline) A programmer's work environment should be a supremely comfortable (newline) place to sit, look at information on a screen, and type. (newline) At ArsDigita (newline) we accomplish this via providing Aeron chairs, the keyboard of the (newline) programmer's choice, and at least two monitors. (newline) In the summer, the (newline) place should air-conditioned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. (newline) In (newline) the winter, the office should be heated and humidified (often (newline) neglected). (newline) The air should be cleaned year-round with high-efficiency (newline) mechanical filters and electronic cleaners so that allergy sufferers (newline) are not discouraged from working. (newline) One horrible mistake that we made was letting our architect design the (newline) workstations. (newline) Each programmer was given a 6'x2' desk, 12 square feet (newline) total. (newline) Two 21" monitors took up so much depth that there wasn't even (newline) room for a keyboard. (newline) Immediately we had to toss our monitors and get (newline) flat panels (cost about $400,000 extra). (newline) IBM had a better architect (newline) for its Santa Theresa facility: Gerald McCue. (newline) He found that each (newline) worker needed 100 square feet of dedicated space and 30 square feet of (newline) work surface. (newline) McCue also found that programmers needed noise (newline) isolation from enclosed offices or high partitions but personally we (newline) think this rule is worth breaking in a dotcom world where a team has (newline) to work fast and in sync. (newline) Better to manage noise by spreading desks (newline) apart a bit so that there are fewer programmers in a given area and (newline) therefore fewer conversations, fewer telephones, and more (newline) opportunities for sound to be absorbed before reaching someone's ear. (newline) Aesthetic (newline) Programmers don't have the same need for wood-paneled expensive (newline) plushness that, say, corporate lawyers or investment bankers might. (newline) However, the office has to be aesthetically satisfying or it will be (newline) tough for anyone to take seriously the idea that the company values (newline) aesthetic internal design of computer programs. (newline) Similarly, the office (newline) has to be finished and well-executed or nobody will believe that the (newline) organization is committed to finishing products. (newline) In the long run it (newline) is impossible for an organization to be excellent in one area and (newline) mediocre in all others. (newline) So the physical facilities have to look as (newline) though they were planned and decorated by someone with taste. (newline) Note (newline) that this need not be expensive. (newline) You could do it with $200 desks from (newline) Ikea and a consistent set of art posters on the walls. (newline) But an (newline) expensive facility with blank walls and boxes left over from the last (newline) move screams incompetence. (newline) Remember that the overall place has to (newline) look nicer than most of the programmers' houses. (newline) Entertainment (newline) It is easy to make an office more entertaining than the average (newline) person's home. (newline) Most people have a TV at home but they don't have (newline) friends with whom to watch it. (newline) Nor will they typically have the kind (newline) of big-screen equipment that is easy for a company to acquire. (newline) In the (newline) 1980s students at the MIT Media Lab would gather on quite a few nights (newline) to watch movies from analog laserdisks, presented with a very high (newline) quality projector. (newline) After the movie was over, they'd go back to their (newline) desks and work for a few hours, something that would not have happened (newline) if they'd gone out to the movies. (newline) The average home cannot accomodate a pinball machine. (newline) An office can. (newline) The average home can have video games, which are very popular with (newline) young programmers, but not people with whom to play. (newline) The average home (newline) cannot have a grand piano but almost any office can. (newline) Attractive (newline) A worthwhile goal is to have at least one thing that is extremely (newline) attractive about the physical enivronment for any particular (newline) prospective software engineer. (newline) Here's a possible list: (newline) dog-friendly policy (newline) grand piano (newline) climbing wall (newline) indoor garden (newline) aquarium (newline) koi pond (newline) exercise room with fancy machines (newline) pinball machine (newline) Not everyone has a dog. (newline) Not everyone can play the piano. (newline) Not (newline) everyone wants to practice rock climbing. (newline) But by having a long list (newline) in the same building, there is a good chance that at least one item (newline) will be very attractive to a particular person. (newline) If a person loves (newline) gardens, he or she can be seated at a desk within view of the garden. (newline) That person won't value the other items, perhaps, but another employee (newline) will. (newline) Change of Venue (newline) You can work on all of the preceding dimensions but there will come a (newline) day when a programmer gets restless. (newline) Sitting at exactly the same desk (newline) every day is tedious. (newline) We thought that we could solve this at (newline) ArsDigita by using the Internet and our branch offices. (newline) We'd (newline) encourage programmers from Cambridge to pick up and work at a spare (newline) desk in the Berkeley or Pasadena offices for a week or two. (newline) The idea (newline) did not catch on, however, because it turns out to be disruptive for (newline) one person on a team to disappear. (newline) One of the reasons we've found (newline) open-plan offices effective is that it helps to have one's team (newline) members close enough to look casually at what is on the screen. (newline) What does it take to let the entire team pick up and work somewhere (newline) else for awhile? (newline) A beach house or a ski house within a two-hour drive (newline) of their main office. (newline) It is kind of expensive for an individual to (newline) rent a vacation house year-around, equip it with a DSL line or cable (newline) modem, and pack it with enough desks and computers for a team to work. (newline) But if you've got a group of 30 programmers and get a house large (newline) enough for 6 or so to sleep and work, the cost is manageable. (newline) In the (newline) winter, a programming team can disappear for a week, ski every morning (newline) and work all afternoon and evening. (newline) In the summer, a team can spend a (newline) week looking out at the ocean... while typing most of the time. (newline) It (newline) costs more than not having the beach house but a lot less than having (newline) employees go off on their own to have fun every weekend and not work. (newline) Turning average programmers into good programmers (newline) It is difficult to hire the most productive programmers in the world. (newline) Oftentimes these people are capable, by themselves, of turning out (newline) entire products, and thus they start their own companies. (newline) If a really (newline) productive programmer works for an established organization, that (newline) organization will usually take extreme steps to keep him or her. (newline) Thus (newline) beyond a certain point it is most effective for an organization to (newline) develop a strategy for creating good programmers internally. (newline) How does one create a good programmer? (newline) Raw materials are important. (newline) You want someone with a strong computer science education, a high IQ, (newline) and an ability to communicate effectively in oral presentations and in (newline) writing. (newline) But without the right experience, such a person will never (newline) be more than an average quality programmer. (newline) These principles are important in building up someone's programming (newline) skills: (newline) A person won't become proficient at something until he or she has (newline) done it many times. (newline) In other words., if you want someone to be really (newline) good at building a software system, he or she will have to have built (newline) 10 or more systems of that type. (newline) A person won't retain proficiency at a task unless he or she has (newline) at one time learned to perform that task very rapidly. (newline) Learning (newline) research demonstrates that the skills of people who become accurate (newline) but not fast deteriorate much sooner than the skills of people who (newline) become both accurate and fast. (newline) Technology shifts force a programmer to go through bursts of (newline) learning every year or two. (newline) Look around your organization. (newline) You can make a list of the people (newline) qualified to design and build a new system by counting up those who've (newline) built 10 or more similar systems in the past, at least two in the last (newline) year, and that could do the entire job in a month or two if they (newline) really had to. (newline) These are your "good programmers". (newline) Everyone else is a (newline) candidate to be turned into a good programmer as quickly as possible. (newline) Learning to design and build software systems requires that the (newline) programmer design and build software systems. (newline) These can be smaller (newline) subprojects for internal or external customers, standalone software (newline) system for non-profit organizations, or demonstration systems to be (newline) written up and distributed to other programmers. (newline) A particularly (newline) effective option that is only available in the Web world is to build (newline) and launch a free public service. (newline) See http://remindme.arsdigita.com (newline) and http://towzone.arsdigita.com (newline) for examples of one-evening training projects. (newline) Whatever the training task, the pace must be ruthlessly brisk. (newline) The (newline) learner should be expected to build at the same pace as an experienced (newline) developer. (newline) The difference between the learner and the wizard is that (newline) you expect the learner to make a lot of mistakes. (newline) The system as built (newline) may be awkward or not handle error cases properly. (newline) That's okay. (newline) Training research shows that if you get speed now you can get quality (newline) later. (newline) But if you don't get speed you will never get quality in the (newline) long run. (newline) We practice this technique in 6.916, Software Engineering (newline) for Web Applications, our course at MIT. (newline) Each student builds five (newline) database-backed Web applications during the 13-week semester. (newline) The (newline) first few that they build, during the course of the problem sets, are (newline) not necessarily elegant or optimal, but by the end of the semester (newline) they've become remarkably proficient, especially when you consider (newline) that each student is taking three or four other classes. (newline) If you see one of your best people walking out the door at 6:00 pm, (newline) try to think why you haven't challenged that person with an (newline) interesting project. (newline) If you see one of your average programmers (newline) walking out the door at 6:00 pm, recognize that this person is not (newline) developing into a good programmer. (newline) An average programmer's (newline) productivity will never be significant in a group of good programmers. (newline) If you care about profits, you must either come up with a new training (newline) program for the person or figure out the best way to terminate his or (newline) her employment with your organization. (newline) Still not convinced? (newline) Take a look at the Japanese "code factory" circa (newline) 1990. (newline) These precisely organized large organizations where each person (newline) had his role, however small, were supposed to overtake the American (newline) approach where small teams of craftsmen worked in a comparatively (newline) disorganized manner. (newline) The factory approach sometimes produces (newline) acceptable corporate IT solutions but for innovation and successful (newline) product development, the craft approach has been overwhelmingly (newline) vindicated. (newline) Turning good programmers into good managers (newline) As noted in the introduction, software engineering is different (newline) because the organization can't afford to lose the individual (newline) productivity of the best people as they are pushed into management. (newline) At ArsDigita, for example, a manager who is one or two levels up from (newline) the leaf nodes is still expected to write code, develop SQL data (newline) models, write system design documents, and write journal articles. (newline) Yet managers who are spending a portion of their time designing (newline) software or writing documentation are at risk of neglecting their (newline) duties to review subordinates' work. (newline) The classic problem situation at ArsDigita is a manager getting lost (newline) in his or her own work and failing to review a subordinate's efforts (newline) for two or three months. (newline) When the review occurs, inevitably the (newline) subordinate has either been working on the wrong thing in the wrong (newline) way or hasn't been sufficiently productive. (newline) At this point the manager (newline) is really angry. (newline) Three months of calendar time and money have been (newline) wasted. (newline) But should the manager be angry with the employee? (newline) If the (newline) manager had reviewed the subordinate every week, the company would (newline) never have been at risk of losing more than one week of time and (newline) money. (newline) Our solution is to decouple responsibility for review from (newline) responsibility for scheduling review. (newline) We use administrative (newline) assistants to ensure that each manager is scheduled to look at every (newline) subordinate's work at least once per week, more frequently in the case (newline) of junior employees. (newline) It has proven remarkably more effective when a (newline) neutral third-party is responsible for scheduling than when people (newline) with incentives to shirk are responsible for scheduling. (newline) Management by Consensus Considered Harmful (newline) Leaf-node engineers at every company on this planet think that they (newline) have better business ideas than the senior managers. (newline) Why not simply (newline) turn the company over to the engineers to run? (newline) Each engineer has a (newline) different set of better business ideas. (newline) Software engineering companies will tend to have a fairly flat (newline) distribution of intelligence. (newline) The 22-year-old Stanford CS punk that (newline) was just hired will be just as smart as the 30-year-old lead engineer (newline) who will be just as smart as the 40-year-old CEO. (newline) Within a company's (newline) technical team, the raw IQ differences are even smaller. (newline) If each (newline) member of the team were playing the Bach Partitas and Sonatas for Solo (newline) Violin, the wrong notes, shaky intonation, and bad phrasing would make (newline) it pretty obvious to the novices that they needed to take advice from (newline) the experts. (newline) But because software quality is tough to measure and (newline) software quantity is seldom measured, the novices in a software (newline) engineering group are able to think of themselves as experts. (newline) What would be wrong with a completely egalitarian software engineering (newline) group? (newline) Maybe the entire team really is at the same level of ability. (newline) And suppose that somehow the challenge of getting everyone to attack (newline) the same problem had been surmounted. (newline) Remember what Fred Brooks said (newline) in The Mythical Man-Month: high quality systems must be (newline) architected by no more than two people. (newline) Getting design input from leaf-node engineers is important for having (newline) a good product design. (newline) But at the end of the day nobody should be (newline) confused as to who is providing leadership. (newline) There is an irreducible (newline) amount of Engineer A imposing his or her design on Engineer B. (newline) This (newline) can lead to some harsh-sounding words and bruised feelings. (newline) Microsoft (newline) is not the self-esteem company, at least if you believe Playboy (newline) magazine's interview with Bill Gates: "We hear you're brusque at (newline) times, that you won't hesitate to tell someone their idea is the (newline) stupidest thing you've ever heard. It's been called management by (newline) embarrassment challenging employees and even leaving some in tears." (newline) Truly elite organizations can be far worse than Microsoft. (newline) Ask a (newline) group of surgical interns and residents how much respect they get from (newline) the surgeons. (newline) Go into a world-class biology department and ask the (newline) grad students and post-docs about their treatment at the hands of the (newline) professors. (newline) Wherever You Go, There You Are (newline) Performance management textbooks will tell you that workers don't (newline) improve unless they get feedback. (newline) Joe Widgetmaker should get a nice (newline) chart, updated daily, of how many widgets he has produced personally (newline) each day, and how many have been built by his team. (newline) Consider the average working programmer's life: (newline) surfing USENET (newline) surfing Slashdot (newline) reading docs (newline) questioning colleagues (newline) writing specs and designs (newline) writing docs (newline) writing code (newline) testing code (newline) fixing bugs (newline) filing bug reports on others' code (newline) attending meetings (newline) helping sales and marketing staff (newline) (For comparison to the grad student life, see http://philip.greenspun.com/humor/graduate-student-emotion-check-list.) (newline) Characterizing this person's productivity is going to require more (newline) than one number. (newline) But if we don't do it, days or weeks could slip by (newline) without the programmer realizing that his or her achievement levels (newline) are plummeting. (newline) In a company with disorganized or technically (newline) clueless managers, the programmer's supervisory chain won't notice the (newline) lack of achievement either. (newline) Production of documentation and code is generally measurable by (newline) reference to the company's version control system. (newline) Bugs filed and (newline) fixed are easily tallied by looking at the company's ticket/bug (newline) tracking system (see http://www.arsdigita.com/doc/ticket for a (newline) description of our favorite open-source ticket/bug tracker). (newline) The (newline) softer stuff can still be quantified but it will have to be done by (newline) humans filling out forms. (newline) Ideally the programmer will get daily feedback, which is kept private (newline) unless the individual elects to publicize it. (newline) Performance in each (newline) sanctioned area of activity will be marked up and scored with (newline) a weight. (newline) The programmer can then see if his or her crude achievement (newline) level is going up or down. (newline) Summary (newline) Building and managing a peak-performing software engineering (newline) organization is challenging but extremely profitable. (newline) The core Ariba (newline) product was written by two programmers, yielding a market (newline) capitalization of $30 billion. (newline) Microsoft Internet Explorer is a much (newline) better browser than Netscape Navigator and yet it was written by a (newline) much smaller team: only about 30 developers. (newline) Start by attracting a good core team, perhaps by setting up an (newline) organization that enables each engineer to excel along the axes (newline) defined in http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/professionalism-for-software-engineers. (newline) Provide a productive working environment and a physical environment (newline) that is better than the average programmer's house. (newline) Provide daily (newline) positive reinforcement. (newline) Provide daily feedback showing the programmer (newline) more or less exactly what he or she has accomplished, plus a graph for (newline) the preceding few months showing the trend. (newline) Aim to install a feeling (newline) of ownership in each worker. (newline) More (newline) Bringing out the Best in People (Aubrey Daniels 1999; (newline) McGraw Hill).

(newline) In terms of (newline) having an equal distribution of ability among all levels of the (newline) enterprise, the closest industry to software engineering is management (newline) consulting. (newline) Maister's work is a classic guide to success in this industry.

In a (newline) healthier organization culture, people are thought to be professional (newline) to the extent they are knowledgeable and competent." (newline) (See http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/professionalism-for-software-engineers (newline) for ArsDigita's independent conception of this idea.) (newline) Much of the (newline) rest of the book is a celebration of the 40-hour work week and the (newline) claim that "overtime" in the long run is never beneficial. (newline) If the (newline) authors were correct, Silicon Valley would be the poorest region of (newline) the nation, with Redmond, Washington the 2nd most impoverished.
